1.7 Roles of Entrepreneurs (SAQ 1.4)
1.1 Entrepreneurship – Origin
Various scholars have written extensively on the origin of entrepreneurship. What is
interesting is that most of the scholars who wrote about the origin of entrepreneurship are
either economists or historians. Basically, the concept entrepreneur is derived from the
French concept “entreprendre” which literarily is equivalent to the English concept “to
undertake”. From the business point of view, to undertake simply means to start a business
(QuickMBA, 2010). From the historical point of view, Schumpeter (1951) opined that the
French economist Richard Cantillon, was the first to introduce the concept ""entrepreneur""
in his work in 1755. He viewed the entrepreneur as a risk taker (Burnett, 2000).
However, some scholars contend that it was an economist, Jean-Baptiste Say, who analysed
the concept in an advanced way in his work in 1821 where he identified entrepreneur as
new economic phenomenon (Wikipedia, 2010). Given the foregoing, we can infer that the
concept “entrepreneur” is almost as old as the formal discipline of economics itself
(Schumpeter, 1951) especially given the fact that it was economists such as Adam Smith,
David Ricardo, and John Stuart Mill who have written extensively on it, albeit referring to it
as ""business management”. However, unlike Smith and Ricardo, Mill stressed the
significance of entrepreneurship for economic growth. Another renowned economist, Alfred
Marshall buttressed Mill’s view by formally recognizing entrepreneurship as an important
factor of production in 1890; he viewed entrepreneurship as organization creation and
believed that entrepreneurship is the driving element behind organization (Schumpeter,
1951; Burnett, 2000).
11.2 An Overview of the Definitions of Entrepreneurship and Entrepreneur
1.1.1 Entrepreneurship
There are many definitions of the concept ‘entrepreneurship’. For instance, Putari (2006)
observes that scholars had not been in agreement in their definitions of entrepreneurship
and chronicled the definitions of entrepreneurship by various scholars (Brockhaus &
Horwitz, 1986, Sexton & Smilor, Wortman, 1987; Gartner, 1988). Cantillon (circa 1730) views
entrepreneurship as: “self employment of any sort”. In 1934, Joseph Schumpeter equated
entrepreneurship with the concept of innovation and applied it to a business context, while
emphasizing the combination of resources. Penrose (1963) views entrepreneurship as the
activity that involves identifying opportunities within the economic system. While
Leibenstein (1968, 1979) perceives entrepreneurship as involving ""activities necessary to
create or carry on an enterprise where not all markets are well established or clearly
defined and/or in which relevant parts of the production function are not completely
known”. Gartner (1988) conceives entrepreneurship as the creation of new organizations.
Okpara (2000) defines entrepreneurship as the willingness and ability of an individual to
seek out investment opportunities in an environment and be able to establish and run an
enterprise successfully based on the identifiable opportunities. In addition, Nwachukwu
(1990) regards entrepreneurship as a process of seeing and evaluating business
opportunities, gathering the necessary resources to take advantage of them and initiate
appropriate action to ensure success.
After critically studying the above definitions, we can summarize by concluding that
entrepreneurship is a function which involves the exploitation of opportunities which exist
within a market.
Box 1.1 Definitions of entrepreneurship
21.1.2 Entrepreneur
Scholars have also given several definitions of the concept ‘entrepreneur’. For instance in
1816, Putari (2006) quoted Say who asserts that the entrepreneur is the agent ""who unites
all means of production and who finds in the value of the products...the reestablishment of
the entire capital he employs, and the value of the wages, the interest, and rent which he
pays, as well as profits belonging to himself."" He views entrepreneurs as change agents (Say,
1816). Knight (1921) views entrepreneurs as individuals who attempt to predict and act
upon change within markets.
Schumpeter (1934) conceives the entrepreneur as the innovator who implements change
within markets through the carrying out of new combinations such as introduction of new
techniques of production, reorganization of an industry and innovation. He further argues
that the entrepreneur is an innovator, one that introduces new technologies into the
workplace or market, increasing efficiency, productivity or generating new products or
services (Deakins and Freel, 2009).
Cantillon (circa 1730) conceptualized the entrepreneur as: the ""agent who buys means of
production at certain prices in order to combine them"" into a new product (Schumpeter,
1951). In Quick MBA (2010), the entrepreneur is defined as one who combines various input
factors in an innovative manner to generate value to the customer with the hope that this
value will exceed the cost of the input factors, thus generating superior returns that result in
the creation of wealth.
The entrepreneur is the person who perceives the market opportunity and then has the
motivation, drive and ability to mobilize resources to meet it (Di-Masi, 2010).
An entrepreneur is a person who has possession of a new enterprise, venture or idea and
assumes significant accountability for the inherent risks and the outcome (Wikipedia, 2010).
The entrepreneur is anyone who has the capacity and willingness to undertake conception,
31.1.3 Intrapreneurs
There are given situations where an entrepreneur is not able to establish his or her own
business and as such has to work in an organization. In this case they are referred to as
‘Intrepreneurs’ i.e. entrepreneurs within an organization. These individuals are
entrepreneurs in their own right because they pursue the exploitation of business
opportunities as they emerge and are also visionaries within a given organization. Thus,
once identified, these individuals should be encouraged to manifest their entrepreneurial
abilities to the benefit of the organization otherwise they will be frustrated and may leave
the organization or start their own businesses. Entrepreneurship is the processes and
activities by which corporate organization behave entrepreneurially.
o How is entrepreneur differ from intrapreneur
 An entrepreneur is a person who create a venture or startup a business and nature
it, takes risks of bringing together the factors of production to meet the society’s
need at a profit, while an intrapreneur work within an existing organization to
pursue the exploitation of business opportunities
1.1.4 Technopreneur
41.2 Types of entrepreneur
Based on the interaction with the business environment, various types of entrepreneurs can
emerge. To this effect, Rockstar (2008) identifies the four types of entrepreneurs as
Innovative, Imitating, Fabian and Drone.
1.2.1 Innovative
This type of entrepreneur is preoccupied with introducing something new into the market,
organization or nation. They are interested in innovations and invest substantially in
research and development.
1.2.2 Imitating
These are also referred to as ‘copy cats’. They observe an existing system and replicate it in
a better manner. They could improve on an existing product, production process,
technology and through their vision create something similar but better. This is the case of
the student becoming better than the master!
1.2.3 Fabian
These are entrepreneurs that are very careful and cautious in adopting any changes. Apart
from this, they are lazy and shy away from innovations.
1.2.4 Drone
These are entrepreneurs that are resistant to change. They are considered as ‘old school’.
They prefer to stick to their traditional or orthodox methods of production and systems.
Entrepreneurs occupy three roles, namely as agent of (1) economic change (2) social change
and (3) technological change. These are referred to as behavioral roles.
The types and roles of entrepreneur notwithstanding, all entrepreneurs possess certain
characteristics and are motivated to become entrepreneur due to certain factors or
circumstances which we shall discuss in this unit.
1.3 Characteristics of Entrepreneurship and Entrepreneurs
Scholars do not agree on the characteristics possessed by entrepreneurs. Hence, several
scholars through various studies identified several characteristics or traits possessed by
entrepreneurs some of which are discussed as follows. For instance,Rockstar (2008)
recognized the characteristics of entrepreneurship as:
Creative Activity: Entrepreneurship entails innovations. It deals with product innovation,
production techniques innovation while bearing in mind the market;
Dynamic Process: Entrepreneurship is a dynamic process that has to bear in mind the
dynamic business environment.
51.4. Roles of Entrepreneurs
In order to perform their functions effectively and operate a successful business,
entrepreneurs have to perform certain roles. These roles are the same as the basic
managerial roles which are identified by Henry Mintzberg in 1973. They are as follows:
Figure Head Role: The entrepreneur has to act as figure head in the organization, as such;
he/she has to perform ceremonial duties. This is done by representing the organization in
formal and informal functions.
Leader Role: The entrepreneur has to act as a leader because the entrepreneur is the one
who brings other people together in order to create the business. Thus, he/she has to lead
the people in the organization by hiring, firing, training and motivating them.
Liaison Role: The entrepreneur has to act as the link between the business and the parties
outside the business.

2.1 Entrepreneur motivations
Motivation is the driving force within individuals that propel them to action.
Entrepreneurial motivations are those factors that propel individuals to become
entrepreneurs. Scholars have conducted various researches on entrepreneurial motivations
and have come up with several factors that motivate people to become entrepreneurs.
Some scholars have adopted the trait approach and come up with certain traits and
characteristics that they believe entrepreneurs possess.
152.2 Motivational Influences on Entrepreneurship or Bright Side of
Entrepreneurs
Bright side refers to the positively energizing influence of each of the issues listed below.
Shane et al. (2010) identified the motivational influences on entrepreneurship as:
162.2.1 Need for Achievement
David C. McClelland, a psychologist, the father of the Need for Achievement Theory posits
that individuals who are high in N Ach are more likely than those who are low in N Ach to
become entrepreneurs. This is because such individuals tend to engage in activities or tasks
that have a high degree of individual responsibility for outcomes, require individual skill and
effort, have a moderate degree of risk, and include clear feedback on performance. In a
nutshell, these individuals effectively operate in situations in which they can achieve results
through their own efforts, pursue moderately difficult goals and receive relatively
immediate feedback on the outcomes of their performance (Unilag, 2007).
2.2.2 Risk taking Propensity
Risk-taking propensity has been defined in the entrepreneurship literature as the willingness
to take moderate risks (Begley, 1995). This motivational influence on entrepreneurship is an
offshoot of the need for achievement factor, for individuals with a high need for
achievement would have moderate propensities to take risk. This is because activities with
moderate risk are challenging and at the same time appear to be attainable (Atkinson,
1957).
2.2.3 Tolerance for Ambiguity
According to Budner (1962), an ambiguous situation is ""one which cannot be adequately
structured or categorized by an individual because of the lack of sufficient cues while he
defined intolerance of ambiguity as the tendency to perceive ambiguous situations as
sources of threat. And Teoh and Foo (1997) define tolerance of ambiguity as the ability to
respond positively to ambiguous situations. Thus, because the entrepreneur creates a new
business in an uncertain and risky situation, an individual that has intolerance for ambiguity
cannot be an entrepreneur.
2.2.4 Locus of Control
This refers to the extent to which an individual believes in fate and their ability to control
fate. Individuals who have an external locus of control believe that the outcome of an event
is outside their control, and view fate as mainly determined by external forces and luck. On
the other hand, individuals with an internal locus of control believe that their personal
actions directly affect the outcome of an event. Thus, individuals with internal locus of
control are propelled to become entrepreneurs because they believe that they control their
fate (Rotter, 1966; UNILAG GST Module 1, 2007).
2.2.5 Self-efficacy
This is conceptualized as the belief in one’s ability to muster and implement the necessary
personal resources, skills, and competencies to attain a certain level of achievement on a
given task. Self-efficacy is basically, task-specific self-confidence (Bandura, 1997; Shane et
al., 2010). An individual with high self-efficacy will take negative feedback in a more positive
manner and use that feedback to improve his/her performance hence is more likely to
become an entrepreneur.
2.2.6 Desire for Independence
This could be in terms of financial or job independence. Independence entails taking the
responsibility to use one’s own judgment as opposed to blindly following the assertions of
others. It also involves taking responsibility for one’s own life rather than living off the
efforts of others. An entrepreneur is a decision maker and must have a mind of his/her own.
172.2.7 Drive
Shane et al. (2003) used this concept to refer to the willingness to put forth effort (i.e. both
the effort of thinking and the effort involved in bringing one’s ideas into reality). According
to them there are four aspects of drive, namely: (1) ambition; (2) goals; (3) energy and
stamina; and (4) persistence. Thus, once an individual has drive, he will be propelled to
become an entrepreneur.
2.2.8 Egoistic passion
Shane et al. (2003) viewed egoistic passion as a passionate, selfish love of the work.
According to them, the true or rational egoist passionately loves the work; loves the process
of building an organization and making it profitable and is motivated to do what is actually
in his/her own interest. Thus, once an individual has egoistic passion, then he/she is
propelled to become an entrepreneur.
o Identify and discuss any three characteristics of a successful entrepreneurs
 Need for achievement: individuals who effectively operate in situations in which they
can achieve results through their own efforts, pursue moderately difficult goals and
receive relatively immediate feedback on the outcomes of their performance
 Desire for independence: This could be in terms of financial or job independence.
Independence entails taking the responsibility to use one’s own judgment as
opposed to blindly following the assertions of others.
 Self-efficacy will take negative feedback in a more positive manner and use that
feedback to improve his/her performance hence he/she is more likely to become
an entrepreneur.
2.3. Non-Motivational Influences on Entrepreneurs or the Dark Side of
entrepreneur
Non-motivational influences or the dark side is used with reference to the stress producing
tendency of each of the issues discussed below.
2.3.1 Opportunity Cost
According to a study by Amit et al., (2009) entrepreneurs are more likely to undertake
entrepreneurial activities when their opportunity costs are lower. That is paid workers who
chose to become entrepreneurs do so because they have less to lose (i.e. lower opportunity
costs) by leaving their paid work.
2.3.2 Stocks of Financial Capital:
This refers to the amount of money an individual is able to accumulate or stock. Evans and
Leighton (1989) found that the hazard into self-employment is constant in age. And older
workers tend to have the propensity to become entrepreneurs because they would have
had time to build up the capital needed to start a business unlike younger workers.
182.3.3 Social Ties to Investors
The importance of social embeddeding in the creation of a new business has been
appreciated by scholars of entrepreneurship. Aldrich and Zimmer (1986) note that
entrepreneurs are highly social actors and they actively embed themselves in social
contexts. For instance, in the course of their entrepreneurship research, they found that
immigrant entrepreneurs in many cases formed ethnic networks to share capital or business
in order to overcome hostility in the host countries. Thus, given these conditions, an
individual will be propelled to become an entrepreneur.
2.3.4 Career Experience
This is closely related to unsatisfactory work experience. If an individual is not happy with
his/her job and has acquired a great deal of experience on the job and possesses
entrepreneurial abilities, then there is the tendency for the person to become an
entrepreneur.
2.3.5. Life-Path Circumstances
This refers to individual circumstances within the life-path of individuals that propel them to
become entrepreneurs. These are factors such as:
2.3.6 Unsatisfactory Work Environment
When an individual is dissatisfied with his work environment or finds the work environment
unconducive, then in rebellion, he will quit the job and seek alternative employment.
However, if the individual in question is an entrepreneur, then he is likely going to start his
own business.
2.3.7.Negative Displacement
This arises when unforeseen circumstances in an individual’s life-path causes the person to
make major changes in lifestyle. This could be an accident, the loss of dear ones or sponsors
etc. When such occurrences happen, the individual is forced to undergo a drastic change in
the lifestyle and as such may become an entrepreneur.
2.3.8 Career Transition
This situation arises when an individual is between one career-related activity and another.
For instance, when an individual who was initially a copy typist goes to Secretarial School
and obtains a certificate, then there is a career transition which can necessitate the creation
of a new business.
2.3.9 Positive Pull Influences
This refers to centers of influence within the society. That is, individuals whom people look
up to as mentors encourage a person to become an entrepreneur.
2.3.10 Background Characteristics
This has to do with factors such as: childhood, family environment, education, age and work
history. It is believed that position in the family, i.e. whether first born, last born, only child,
upbringing, educational level and age influence the propensity of the individual to become
an entrepreneur. For instance, an issue of debate among scholars is whether entrepreneurs
tend to be only child or first born child of a family. Other scholars argue that individuals are
more likely to become entrepreneurs when they are between the ages of 25 and 40 years,
while some other scholars contend that individuals are more likely to become
entrepreneurs when they are between the ages of 22 and 55 years. Another group of
192.4 Entrepreneurship Variables
What factors affect the supply of entrepreneurship? Basically, two factors affect the supply
of entrepreneurship: opportunity and willingness to become an entrepreneur. Opportunity
is the possibility to become self-employed if one wants to. The primary factors that affect
opportunity are:
2.4.1 The individual’s intrinsic entrepreneurial ability and intuition (Allinson, Chell &
Hayes, 2000).
The degree to which the spirit of enterprise exists or can be initiated in the individual is
through the society, by the society and culture in which he is embedded (Morrison, 1998).
2.4.2 The general macro-economic environment.
One of the primary determinants of the supply of entrepreneurship is the willingness of an
individual to become an entrepreneur. Willingness is a personalized activity. It goes beyond
intentions and/or new idea conceptualization. Willingness must lead to the creation of
enterprise from nothing (Timmons, 1989).It also involves the relative evaluation of work in
self employment compared with one’s other options for employment (Praag et al, 1995).
The supply of entrepreneurship is seen thus, to be dependent on both individual level
factors and general economic and non-economic factors.
To encourage entrepreneurship, policy makers can improve the economic factors that face
entrepreneur by initiating reforms that increase both the market incentives and availability
of credit and capital to entrepreneurs (Wilken, 1972). Therefore, instituting appropriate
market and tax regulations a country can encourage and increase the supply of
entrepreneurs in its population. The second major determinant of the supply of the
entrepreneurship is opportunity. In order for an individual to start his own enterprise, it is
necessary for him to have the credit or capital to finance the initial start-up cost. Policy
makers can encourage the supply of entrepreneurship by creating programmes and
institutions such as SMEDAN to encourage and assist entrepreneurs to find capital, draw-up
business plans, and comply with the various business and tax regulations.
On developing entrepreneurship, new education initiatives could be created to teach
entrepreneurship. By equipping more people with the skills’ attitudes and characteristics to
become entrepreneurs; by promoting and developing entrepreneurial spirit within the
society, a country can effectively increase its supply entrepreneurs.
2.5 Creativity
The terms creativity and innovation are often used to mean the same thing, but each has a
unique connotation. Creativity is ‘’ the ability to bring something new into existence.”This
emphasizes the “ability,” not the “activity,” of bringing something new into existence. A
person may therefore concieve of something new and envision how it will be useful, but not

Illumination: Verification:
Recognition of idea Application or test to
as being feasible prove idea has value
realization validation
Source: Holt (1992)
According to Holt (1992), the creative process comprises the following five stages as shown
in figure 1:
1. Idea germination
Exactly how an idea is germinated is a mystery; it is not something that can be examined
under the microscope. For most entrepreneurs, ideas begin with interest in a subject or
curiosity about finding a solution to a particular problem.
2. Preparation
Once a seed of curiosity has taken form as a focused idea, creative people embark on a
conscious search for answers. If it is a problem they are trying to solve, then they begin an
intellectual journey, seeking information about the problem and how others have tried to
resolve it. Inventors will set up laboratory experiments, designers will begin engineering
new product ideas, and marketers will study consumer buying behaviour.
3. Incubation
The idea, once seeded and given substance through preparation, is put on a back burner,
the subconscious mind is allowed time to assimilate information. Incubation is a stage of
‘mulling it over’. When an individual has consciously worked to resolve a problem without
success, allowing it to incubate in the subconscious will often lead to a resolution.
4. Illumination
Illumination occurs when the idea surfaces as a realistic creation. This stage is critical for
entrepreneurs because ideas, by themselves, have little meaning. Reaching the illumination
stage separates daydreamers and tinkerers from creative people who find a way to
transmute values.
212.6 Innovation and its benefits
Zimmerer, Scarborough, and Wilson (2008) define innovation as the specific instrument of
entrepreneurs, the means by which they exploit change as an opportunity for a different
business or a different service. As a dimension of corporate entrepreneurship, innovation is
a firm’s commitment to creating and introducing products, production processes, and
organisational systems (Covin and Slevin, 1991; Lumpkin and Dess, 1996; Zahra, 1996).
Innovation is the process that provides added value and novelty to the firm and its suppliers
and customers through the development of new procedures, solutions, products and
services as well as new methods of commercialisation (Shaw, O’Loughlin and McFadzean,
2005).
According to Knight (1997) and Kreiser, Marino and Weaver (2002) in Scheepers (2007),
innovativeness refers to the capability, capacity and willingness of an enterprise to support
creativity and experimentation to solve recurring customer problems. Innovativeness entails
creativity and experimentation that result in new products, new services, or improved
technological processes (Dess and Lumpkin, 2005). It is arguably the most essential
component of corporate entrepreneurship (Fitzsimmons, Douglas, Antoncic, and Hisrich
(2005).
Innovation is the outcome of the firm’s effective development and use of new technologies
and/or knowledge about market opportunities (Ireland, Hitt, Camp, and Sexton, 2001).
For a firm to be innovative, it needs to have a free-wheeling, “boundary less” brainstorming
culture to engender creative ideas (Khandwalla and Mehta, 2004). It also requires that
organisations depart from existing technologies and practices and venture beyond the
222.6.1 Forms of Innovations
According to Hamel (1997) in Dess and Lumpkin (2005), innovations come in different
forms:
Technological innovativeness primarily comprises research and engineering efforts aimed
at developing new products and processes.
Products-market innovativeness consists of market research, products design, and
innovations in advertising and promotion.
Administrative innovativeness is concerned with novelty in management systems, control
techniques, and organisational structure.
Innovation can also be classified in terms of whether it is incremental, modular,
architectural or radical (Henderson and Clark, 1990 in Hager, 2006):
Incremental Innovation: This comprises relatively small modifications to pre-existing
solutions (Scheepers, 2007). In the view of Henderson and Clark (1990) in Hager (2006), this
type of innovation improves and extends an established design. Improvement takes place in
individual components, but the basic core design concepts and the linkage between them
remain the same. An example is faster spinning hard drives.
Modular Innovation: This kind of innovation changes the core design of one or more
components but does not change the entire product architecture. This type of innovation
requires new knowledge for one or more components, but the architectural knowledge
remains the same. A good example is the digital phone which replaced the analog phone,
without changing the phone itself (Henderson and Clark, 1990 in Hager, 2006).
Architectural Innovation: The essence of this type of innovation is the reconfiguration of an
established system to link together components and parts in a new way (Henderson and
Clark, 1990 in Hager, 2006). According to the authors, architectural innovation does not
mean that the components remain unchanged but they are changed in a manner that there
are new ways of linkage between the components. The change is so small that the core
concept behind the changed component is the same, and the associated scientific and
engineering knowledge remain the same. An example is the technologies where
architectural innovations reduced the size of the hard drives from 14-inches diameter disks
to diameter of 3.5-inches, and from 2.5-inches to 1.8-inches.
232.6.2 Phases in Successful Innovation
Desouza, Dombrowski, Awazu, Baloh, Papagari, Kim, and Jha, (2007) identify the following
five essential phases of successful innovation:
Idea Generation and Mobilisation
This phase is the starting point for new ideas. Successful idea generation should be
stimulated by the pressure to compete and by the freedom to explore. Once a new idea is

3.1 An Overview of the Concept of Business
The concept ‘business’ has been defined in different ways by various authors. It has been
viewed as an economic system in which goods and services are exchanged for one another
for money, on the basis of their perceived worth (BusinessDictionary.com, 2010). A business
is also conceived as a legally recognized organization. It is also referred to as: enterprise,
business enterprise, commercial enterprise, company, firm, profession or trade operated for
the purpose of earning a profit by providing goods or services, or both to consumers,
businesses and governmental entities (Sullivan and Sheffrin, 2003; AllBusiness.com., 2010).
Whatever is the definition of business, it should be known that a business is any undertaking
that deals with the production and distribution of goods and services that satisfy human
needs and wants. Businesses do not exist out of the ‘blues’! They are created by a special
kind of labour called the entrepreneur. However, once the businesses have been created
the entrepreneur has to organize all the factors of production to ensure that the business
survives. The purpose for which a business is established varies and by virtue of this we have
different types of businesses. For instance if a business is established for the purpose of
making a profit, it is called a profit making business, otherwise, it is called a not-for-profit or
non-profit making business. Also businesses could be classified as legal, when they are
established in compliance with the rules of the land, government or society. Illegal
businesses are those that do not follow established laws. Legal businesses can also be
referred to as wholesome businesses because they are beneficial to the society. On the
other hand, unwholesome businesses are illegal businesses that are inimical to the society.
For businesses to survive and achieve their set goals and objectives, they have to perform
the organic business functions. These are the basic functions every business has to perform:
production, marketing, finance and personnel. However, care should be taken in not
343.2 The Concept of Environment
The concept ‘environment’ literally means the surroundings, internal, intermediate and
external objects, influences or circumstances under which someone or something exists
(Kazmi, 1999). The environment within which something exists exhibits certain
characteristics which have been identified by Kazmi (1999) to be: complexity, dynamism,
multifaceted and far-reaching impact. These are apart from the simple and stable
environmental conditions.
The business environment is simply the surroundings within which a business exists. The
environment of the business exhibits the following conditions and characteristics. These are:
Stable Condition: This environment is highly predictable, thus permitting a great deal of
standardization (work process, skills and output) to take place within the organization.
Simple Condition: This environment is one where knowledge can be broken down into
easily comprehended components (Minzberg, 1979).
Dynamism: The business environment is not static. It is dynamic and as such changes
continuously. This is because of the interactions of the various factors that make up the
business environment.
Complexity: The business environment is not simple; it is complex by virtue of the various
components that comprise it and the interactions and interrelationships among these
factors.
Multifaceted: The business environment is many-sided. It can be viewed from many angles
by the parties involved. Hence, an occurrence that is viewed as strength to an organization
may be perceived as a weakness by another.
Far-reaching impact: The happenings in the business environment can have enormous
impact on the organization. It could have the ripple effect. This is because the business
environment can be conceived as a system, specifically an open system made up of different
components that interact and interrelate with one another. Hence, once there is a problem
or development with one aspect/sector, it could have far-reacing impact on the other
aspects/sectors (Kazmi, 1999).
By virtue of the above characteristics, it is important for the entrepreneur to monitor the
business environment constantly. Thus, it is of fundamental importance for the
entrepreneur to monitor both the key macro-environmental forces
(demographic/economic, technological, political/legal and social/cultural) and micro-
environmental forces (customers, competition, distribution channels, and suppliers) that
will affect their ability to earn profits in the market place (Kotler, 1995). These macro-
353.3 Components of the Business Environment – An overview
Scholars have classified the business environment using various basis or criteria. This
notwithstanding, it should be noted that the business environment is made up of the
internal and the external environment and the main macro-environmental forces/factors
found in the external environment and micro-environmental forces/factors/ in the internal
environment of the business. These are discussed briefly in succeeding sections.
Internal Environmental Factors: The internal environmental factors refer to those factors
over which the entrepreneur has control, at least in the short run; this is why it is also called
the controllable environment of the business. The internal environment of the business is
made up of all those physical and socials factors within the boundaries of the business,
which impart strengths or cause weaknesses of a strategic nature and are taken directly into
consideration in the decision-making behavior of the business. Strengths are inherent
capacities, which a business can use to gain strategic advantage over its competitors; they
are the internal strong points of the business such as: its core skills, competencies and
expertise. While weaknesses are inherent limitations or constraints, which create strategic
disadvantages, they are the internal factors that are lacking in the business. A successful
entrepreneur will find ways of overcoming the weaknesses and convert them into strengths
(Ifechukwu, 1986; Kazmi, 1999; Business-Plan, 2010). The internal environment of the
business is made up of micro-environmental factors such as: organizational goals and
objectives, specific technologies utilized by component units of the organization, the size,
types and quality of personnel, its administrative units, and the nature of the organization’s
product/service (Ifechukwu, 1986). The nature of a business’ internal environment is also
determined by the organizational resources, organizational behaviour, strengths,
weaknesses, synergistic relationships and distinctive competence (Kazmi, 1999).
Kazmi’s (1999) views Organizational resources as the physical and human resources used
as inputs in the organization to create outputs.
Organizational behaviour is the manifestation of the various forces and influences
operating in the internal environment of an organization.
Strengths are inherent capabilities that give strategic advantage.
Weaknesses are inherent limitations or constraints, which create strategic disadvantage.
Synergy is an idea that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, i.e. 3+3=7.
Distinctive competence: The specific ability possessed by a particular organization that
distinguishes it from others.
Organizational capability: This is the inherent capacity or ability of an organization to use its
strengths, and overcome its weaknesses in order to exploit opportunities and face threats in
its external environment.
363.3.1 Intermediate Environmental Factors
Intermediate determinants of entrepreneurship ideally represent issues or factors in the
borderlines between strictly internal and external factors affecting entrepreneurship.
Generally they include the customers and the suppliers who are the links between the
organization and the purely external environmental factors. They also include various
support systems, both private and public e.g. legal firms and public relations agencies. Some
of such support systems include:
The National Directorate of Employment (NDE): This was established by the Federal
Government of Nigeria in November, 1986. It was designed to work out strategies for
dealing with mass unemployment in the country especially among the school leavers and
college graduates. The mandate given to NDE is executed within the framework of four core
programmes. These are:
 The Small-Scale Industries and Graduate Employment and Vocational Skills
Development.
 Support for Agricultural Programmes.
 National Youth Employment and Vocational Skills Development and
 Special Public Works Programmes.
NDE executes its programmes by providing financial support and training and development
for existing entrepreneurs and new entrants into entrepreneurship (Ogundele, 2007).
Some Financial Support Systems: These include:
 Small Industries Credit Committee.
 National Economic Reconstruction Fund.
 Small and Medium Enterprises Loans Scheme.
 Micro Finance Banks.
 Nigerian Industrial Development Bank.
 Extension Services Units: The Federal Government in 1964 established Industrial
Development Centres (ADC) located in Oshogbo, Owerri and Zaria. They were to
provide extension services to small and medium scale enterprises in terms of
technical appraisal of loans application, managerial assistance, product development
and production planning and control. Later more were created to have IDC in each
state of the Federation.
Technical and Technological Related Support Systems: These include:
 The Federal Institute of Industrial Research, Oshodi (FIRO).
 Project Development Institute (PRODA) in Enugu.
 Rural Agro-Industrial Development Council (RMRDC) etc.
These were established to provide technical and technology related support for Nigerian
entrepreneurs. These support systems as intermediate factor have closer links with the
entrepreneurs to facilitate their operations in various ways.
3.3.2 External Environmental Factors:
The external environmental factors refer to those factors over which the entrepreneur has
no control but have tremendous impact on the survival of the business; this is why it is also
called the uncontrollable environment of the business. Within the external environment of
the business are all the factors which provide opportunities or pose threats to it.
Opportunities are favourable conditions in the business’ environment, which enable it to
consolidate and strengthen its position. They are the likely benefits to the business resulting
from changes in the external environment while threats are unfavorable conditions in the
business’ environment, which create a risk for, or cause damage to, the business; they are
373.4 An Overview of SWOT Analysis
SWOT entails the objective analysis of a business’s Strengths and Weaknesses and its
Opportunities and Threats. In order to identify its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and
threats, an organization has to carry out internal and external evaluation and also
opportunities/threats analysis and strengths/weaknesses analysis.
The Internal Evaluation starts with: The identification of the profit contribution of each area,
followed by allocation of resource, determination of risks involved, variety reduction,
realistic allocation of costs and the assessment of company resources. External evaluation
starts with the determination of market stranding, determination of competitors’ strengths
and weaknesses, assessment of the vulnerability of the business’ main products to
383.4.1 Strengths/Weaknesses Analysis
This involves scanning the internal environment of the business in order to identify its
strengths and weaknesses. The entrepreneur needs to evaluate the strengths and
weaknesses of the business periodically. Also, the entrepreneur can assess the internal
environment of the business by critically looking at the internal factors in terms of the 5s,
namely: Skills, Strategy, Staff, Structure, Systems and Shared Values (Dibb, Simkin, Pride, &
Ferrell, 1991; Aluko, Odugbesan, Gbadamosi & Osuagwu, 1998; Business-Plan, 2010). To do
this effectively the entrepreneur needs to ask him/herself and answer questions pertaining
to the 5s (five ‘s’) in terms of their strengths and weaknesses by developing questionnaires
to ask questions pertaining to major internal environmental factors such as:
Skills: What skills do the organizational members possess?
What are the distinctive competencies of the organization?
Strategy: Does your business have a clear vision and mission?
Are your business objectives/goals derived from its mission?
Does your business have plans?
Do you follow the laid down plans of the business as scheduled?
Does your business have clear strategies to operationalise its policies?
What skills do the organizational members possess?
What are the distinctive competencies of the organization?
Staff: Does the business have qualified staff for the relevant positions?
Are the staff rightly placed?
Does the business have adequate number of personnel to man the various positions?
Structure: Does the business have an organizational structure or organogram?
What type of organization structure does your business adopt?
Are there clear lines of reporting and communication?
Systems: Does your organization have a system?
What kind of systems (e.g. MIS, Accounting, Quality Control, and Inventory) does your
business have in place? (Business-Plan, 2010).
If the answers to these questions are positive/or the factors are present, then you record
them as strengths and if the answers are negative/ the factors are absent, then you record
them as weaknesses. After this, each factor is rated as to whether it is a major strength,
minor strength, neutral factor, minor weakness, or major weakness (Business-Plan, 2010).
3.4.2 Opportunities and Threats Analysis
This involves scanning the external environment of the business in order to identify the
Opportunities and Threats. The entrepreneur can assess the external environment of the
business by critically looking at the opportunities and threats emanating from changes in
the major external environmental factors. For instance opportunities in the technological
environment could be availability of advanced technology, developments in Information
Technology like the advent of the GSM; opportunities in the Political/Legal environment
could be favorable government policies, tax holidays; opportunity in the Demographic
environment could be great market demand; opportunities in the Economic environment

4.1 Consideration for the choice of the form of Business organization
You have to appreciate the fact that there are various forms of business organizations that
exist in the environment. Again, business is a profit-seeking enterprise established for the
purpose of creating goods and services that meet the needs of mankind. Business plays a
major role in the lives of every individual as well as a nation (Oluwafemi, 2000). Business
activities are undertaken to improve the financial and the material welfare of the
participants. A major group that plays an active role in business within a capitalist economy
is the entrepreneur, that is, a person who perceives investment opportunities and takes
advantages to exploit them by organizing for the business (Lawal, 1993).
Selecting a form of business ownership is a landmark step in the creation of a venture. Most
entrepreneurs however are not trained in the finer points of business law. Consequently, it
is imperative that an entrepreneur carefully searches for the types of legal ownership and
then consults an attorney (lawyer), and an accountant or both to verify whether the choice
addresses their specific needs (Scarbough Wilsion and Zimmerer, 2009). One of the main
reasons small businesses fail is that they do not seek legal and accounting help at the
beginning. Nickels, Mchugh and Mchugh (2005) stated that one of the key to success in
starting a new business is to understand how to get the resources you need. To stay in
business, an entrepreneur may need help from someone with more expertise than he/she
has in certain areas, or may help to raise more money to expand. How you form your
business can make tremendous difference in your long-term success as an entrepreneur.
454.2 Forms of Business Ownership
Whether small or large, every business fits one of three categories of legal ownership, sole
proprietorships, partnership, and corporations (Brone and Kurtx, 2009).
464.2.1 Sole Proprietorship
The sole proprietorship is the simplest and most popular form of ownership. This form of
business ownership is designed for a business owned and managed by one individual. Sole
proprietorship is the easiest kind of business for you to explore in your quest for an
interesting career. The sole proprietor is the only owner and ultimate decision maker for the
business. The sole proprietorship has no legal distinction between the sole proprietor status
as an individual and his or her status as a business owner. The simplicity and ease of
formation makes the sole proprietorship the most popular form of ownership in Nigeria.
One approach when naming a business is to visualize the company’s target customer. What
are they like? What are their ages, gender, lifestyles and location? What makes our
company competitive or unique to those customers? Although sole proprietorships are
common in a variety of industries, they are concentrated primarily among small businesses
unit such as repair shops, small retail outlets, and service providers, for example, such as
painters, plumbers, and barbing saloon.
Advantages of proprietorship: Following are the advantages of proprietorship
1) Least cost of business ownership to establish
2) Minimum or no special legal restriction
3) Ownership of all profit
4) No special taxes since business income and proprietors’ income are taxed as one.
5) Maximum incentive to succeed
6) Privacy
7) Flexibility of operation
8) Easy to discontinue
Disadvantages of proprietorship: Following are the disadvantages of proprietorship
1) Unlimited personal liability
2) Limited access to capital for expansion
3) Limited skills and abilities
4) Feelings of isolation /overwhelming time commitment
5) Few fringe benefits
6) Limited growth
7) Lack of continuity for the business that has a limited life span.
4.2.2 Partnership
Another option for organizing a business is to form a partnership. A partnership is a legal
form of business with two or more owners. Partners legally share a business assets,
liabilities, and profits according to the terms of a partnership agreement. The law does not
require a written partnership agreement, also known as the articles of partnership, but it is
wise to work with an attorney to develop an agreement that documents the status, rights
and responsibilities of each partner. The partnership agreement is a document that states
all of the terms of operating the partnership for the protection of each partner involved.
Banks often want to review the partnership agreement before lending the business money.
A partnership agreement can include any legal terms the partner’s desire. The standard
partnership agreement will likely include the following information:
1) Name of the partnership
2) Purpose of the business
3) Location of the business
474.2.3 Dissolution and Termination of a Partnership
Partners expect their business relationships are going to last forever. However, most do not.
There are possibilities that problems may occur when the entrepreneur realizes he or she is
not in charge of his or her own company. Even when partnerships work, there are always
494.3 Limited Liability Companies
The incorporation of companies differs from one country to the other. Each country has a
body of laws that guide the registration and operations of companies. In Nigeria, the
Companies and Allied Matter Act (CAMA) of 1990 is the major law that guides formation
and registration of companies in Nigeria.
4.3.1 Formation of Company and Capacity of Individual
According to Section 18 of CAMA 1990, two or more persons may form and incorporate a
company by complying within requirements of the act. It also specifies the category of
people that can come together to form a company. Section 20 states that anyone in these
categories is not qualified:
 he is less than eighteen years of age;
 he is of unsound mind and has been so found by a court in Nigeria or elsewhere;
 he is an un-discharged bankrupt;
 he is disqualified under Section 254 – which says a person is convicted by a High
Court of any offence in connection with the promotion formation or management of
a company, etc.
Types of Companies: three types of companies can be identified
 Limited by shares
 Limited by guarantee
 An unlimited company.
504.3.2 Private liability Companies
The private liability company can be formed by minimum of two persons and maximum of
fifty persons excluding employees of the company both past and present (according to
Section 22 Subsection 3). The total number of members of a private company shall not
exceed fifty, not including persons who are bonafide in the employment of the company or
were while in that employment and have continued after the determination of that
employment to be, members of the company. The articles of the private company must
restrict the transfer of its shares, i.e. the share of the company is not transferable through
public offer for subscription. The law also requires the name of private company to end
with the word “limited”.
The public liability company is a company where the shareholders are members of the
public. The shares are generally freely transferable. Public companies are large trading
concerns with minimum membership of two but no maximum. The name of a public
company is expected to end with Public Limited Company (PLC).
o Explain limited liability companies?
 Limited liability companies are companies incorporated or registered in Nigeria that
is regarded as an artificial person, such company can sue and be sued. They can take
the form of private or public companies.
4.3.3 Legal Requirement for Registration of Companies
The Companies and Allied Matter Acts specified the documents of incorporation, in section
35 of the acts to include:
 Memorandum of Association;
 Articles of Association;
 Notice of the address of the registered office and head office;
 Statement of the lists and particulars of the first directors of the company;
 Statutory declaration of compliance with the provisions of the acts
 Any other document that may be required by the Corporate Affairs Commission
(CAC), e.g. tax certificate of the directors, etc.
If the promoters have met the requirements of the CAC, a certificate of incorporation or
certificate of registration would be issued and immediately the company becomes an
artificial person or legal entity.
Memorandum and Articles of Association: These two documents constitute the basic
constitution of a company. They are in fact the main incorporation documents. The
provision of the Articles of Association is subsidiary to that of the Memorandum of
Association. In other words, Memorandum of Association is superior to the Articles of
514.4 Co-operative
A form of business ownership which involves a collective ownership of a production,
storage, transportation or marketing organisation is what is referred to as a co-operative.
Some individuals dislike the notions of having owners, managers, workers and buyers as
separate parties with separate goals for business organisation. They envision a situation
whereby people will co-operate with one another as an association and share the wealth
more evenly. This is what necessitates the form of business ownership referred to as
cooperatives.
4.4.1 Types of Co-operative
Consumer/producer co-operative
Workers co-operative
Finance co-operatives
Co-operatives allow small businesses to obtain quantity discounts on purchases, reducing
costs and enabling the co-operative to pass on the savings to its members.
Summary of module 1 study session 4
It goes without saying that it is not easy to choose the best form of business organisation. Its
evidence is outlined in this study session that an entrepreneur may participate in the
business world in a variety of ways. He/She can start a sole proprietorship, partnership,
limited liability company (private or public), or cooperative, There are advantages and
disadvantages to each, but whichever one is selected there are risks. Before you decide
which form is good for you, you need to
 Assess the nature, goals and anticipated future of the business.
 Determine the resources, capabilities, and risk level of the owner.
 Review your current and expected tax situation.
 Understand the laws of your state and other jurisdictional regulations relating to
forms of business ownership.
 Involve professional advisers, such as an attorney and an accountant to advise and
assist with the decision process and take the appropriate action (Scarborough et al,
2009).

5.1 Team: definition and typology
As defined by Daft (1997), a team is a unit of two or more people who interact and
coordinate their work to accomplish a specific goal. A team could also be seen as a group of
people with some common identity. Each of whom possesses particular aptitudes,
knowledge and skills. In addition, personality factors such as cultural experience, values,
needs for affiliation and achievement, along with levels of self-awareness and interpersonal
comfort, who come together to share their perspectives, bias and expertise, to resolve
conflict as well as provide support and recognition through task involvement, social
interaction and emotional expression for a particular mission, along with short and long
term goals and objectives. Members of an effective team usually possess complementary
skills, to achieve common goal.
The implication of this definition is that a team consists of interdependent individuals who
share responsibility for specific outcomes. Thus, at a minimum, there must be shared
responsibilities and interdependence-role, goal interdependence and outcome
interdependence (Giese et al, 2001; Daft, 1997).
5.1.1 Typology of Teams
Many types of teams can exist within an organization, whatever the type of team that an
entrepreneur chooses to have in his enterprise, the goal must be to increase the work of the
organization through effective and efficient actualization of the set goals of the enterprise.
One of the ways to classify teams as proposed by Daft (1997), is in terms of those created as
part of the organization’s formal structure (formal team) and those created to increase
employee participation (self-directed teams or self regulatory teams).
565.1.2 Team Building
Team building, as earlier noted, is the process of creating team features in a group in order
to make them more effective. Team building exercises are very important in the
development of teams that will work together for an extended period of time on a complex
project or series of activities (Darwyn, 2000). Team formation or process is made up of five
stages namely:
Forming :where members find out what the task is, what the rules are and what methods
are appropriate.
Stormy: emotional resistance to demands of task.
Norming: open exchange of views and feelings, cooperation develops
Performing: emergence of solutions to problems, constructive attempts at task completion.
Adjusting: modifications made in the light of feedbacks (Ogundele 2011).
Several authors (Barto et al; 2001; Daft 1997 Roberts et al 2001 Darwyn 2000) have
identified the following as the relevant issues in team building.
Cohesiveness: This is the extent to which membership of a team is positively valued and
members are drawn toward the team. Team building ensures that the social (interpersonal
attraction) as well as task cohesiveness is built into the team.
575.1.3 Characteristics of an Effective and Efficient Team
For a team to be effective, it must possess certain characteristics. These characteristics,
where absent or deficiently present, will naturally result in poor team performance.
These characteristics are:
Shared vision or goal: There must be a vision or goal to which every member of the team
subscribes to. This vision or goal must be understood and shared by all.
Strong team identity: Members must strongly identify with the team. They must feel
themselves as actively belonging to a team.
Results driven structure – The structure of the team should be such that it will facilitate the
achievement of set goals.
Competent team members: The composition of the team is very important. Care should be
taken to ensure that members have task relevant skills, knowledge and attitude that will
ensure goal attainment.
Strong commitment to the team: There is high social and task cohesiveness. The former
ensures good interpersonal relations, while the latter results in feeling of fulfillment arising
from goal achievement.
Clearly defined roles and responsibilities: Every team member knows what his or her role
and an expectation are, and directs his or her energy towards performing them.
Mutual trust: Members trust and believe in one another in other words, there is reciprocity
of trust among members. Mutual thrust ensures smooth interpersonal relations.
Small team size: The size of a team has implications for its performance. Large teams tend
to have disagreements and differences of opinions which may impede goal attainment.
High levels of empowerment: Requisite power and authority is given to team members.
This will enable them get their jobs done without much reference to higher authority.
Effective communication: Information necessary for achieving team goals is freely shared
among members to enhance performance.
Independence among team members: The task of the team is such that there is
interdependency among members. That success of the team is determined, at least in part,
by the success of other members.
Strategies that may be adopted by entrepreneurs in team building, the desire for
organizational effectiveness requires that team perform optimally.
585.2. Benefits of Teamwork and potential problems
In deciding whether to use teams to perform specific tasks, entrepreneurs must consider
both the benefit and cost. Teams by nature, impact positively on both the
output/productivity and satisfaction of members. On the other hand, teams may also create
a situation in which motivation and performance are actually decreased.
However, the entrepreneur must seek to explore the positive impact of teams in creating
more value for his enterprise.
5.2.1 Potential Benefits of Teams
1. Increased level of effort: Employee teams often unleash enormous energy and
creativity from workers who like the idea of using their brains as well as their bodies on the
job. Since the success of teams depends on all the members, exceptional effort is thus made
to ensure goal attainment.
2. Satisfaction of members: Employees have a need for belonging and affiliation.
Working in teams can help meet these needs. Participative teams reduce boredom and
often increase employees’ feeling of dignity and self-worth.
3. Expanded job knowledge: Teams empower employees to bring together knowledge
and ability to task. Multi-skilled employees learn the entire job that the team performs.
Again, the intellectual resources of several members can result in short cuts and alternative
points of view for team decision.
4. Organizational flexibility: Employee teams ensure greater flexibility as expanded job
knowledge allows work to be re-organized and workers reallocated as needed to produce
products and services with great flexibility.
5.2.2 Potential Problems of Teams
1. Power realignment: Successes of teams, especially self-directed teams often create
lesser needs for supervisions. This adjustment may be difficult for the entrepreneur who
fears the loss of status (Bernstein, 1987) when his control diminishes.
2. Free riding: Free riding or social loafing occurs when team members do not exert
equal effort in goal attainment. In large teams, some people are likely to work less, meaning
595.3 Definition and theories of groups
(i) A group is defined as two or more persons who are interacting with one another in
such a manner that each person influences the other(s).
(ii) A group is a collection of people who interact with one another regularly over a
period of time and see themselves to be mutually dependent with respect to the attainment
of one or more goals
5.3.1 Theories of Group Formation
Propinquity: The theory states that individual affiliate with one another because of spatial
geographical proximity e.g. people who sit together always easily form into group.
George Hanmans theory of Activities, interactions and sentiments: The theory states that
the more activities a person shares, the more numerous will be their interactions and the
stronger will their sentiments; and the more sentiment persons have for one another, the
more will be their shared activities and interaction.
Balance theory [Theodore Newcomb] it states that persons are attracted to one another on
the basis of similar attitudes towards commonly relevant objects and goals. Once the
relationship is formed, the participants strive to maintain a symmetrical balance between
the attraction and common attitudes.
Exchange theory is based upon reward – cost outcomes of interaction. A minimum positive
level (rewards greater than cost) of an outcome must exist in order for attraction or
affiliation to take place. Rewards from interactions gratify needs, while costs incur anxiety,
frustration, embarrassment, or fatigue. Propinquity, interaction and common attitude all
have roles in exchange process
In conclusion, practically, people form groups for economic, security and social reasons.
5.3.2 Types of Groups
1) Primary group: they are those characterized by intimate, face-to-face association and
cooperation, they are primary chiefly and fundamentally because they form the social
nature and ideals of the individual. Small group and primary group are similar but can be
differentiated as follows:
A small Group has to meet only the criterion of small size, no attempt is made to assign
precise number, the group must be small enough for face to face interaction and
communication.
Primary group on the other hand, apart from being small, must have a feeling of
comradeship, loyalty and a common sense of values among its members. Hence, all primary
groups are small groups but not all small groups are primary groups.
2) Work Group: it is one created by formal authority of an organisation to transform
resources inputs into product outputs.
3) Formal Group: Created through formal authority for the accomplishment of given
purpose.
605.2.3 Advantages of group to organisation
 Accomplishment of task that cannot be done individually
 Bringing a number of talents to bear on complex and difficult task
 Provide a vehicle for decision making that permits multiple and conflicting views to
be aired and considered
 Provide an efficient means for organisational control of employees
 It serves as critical liaison or coordinating function among served departments.
 Facilitate changes in organisational policies or procedures
 Increase organisational stability by transmitting shared beliefs and values to new
employees.
 Infusing pre-established formal system with dynamism.
 Reservoirs of potential formal managers.
Advantages of group to individuals
 Aiding in learning about the organisation and its environments
 Aiding in learning about oneself
 Provide help in gaining new skills
 Obtaining valued rewards that are not accessible by oneself
 Satisfying important personal needs, especially needs for social acceptance and
affiliation.
 Protection against perceived threats
 Exploitation of leadership potentials in organization
 An outlet of frustration (Ogundele, 2012)
5.2.4 Strategies in Group Development
(i) Forming Stage – Consideration of acceptance behaviour, consideration of benefit to
be gained, the contribution expected the purpose of the group.
615.3.5 Factors affecting group performance and decision making in group
 Group size
 Group Cohesiveness
 Group Composition
 Group Norms
Group Size -: relates to the number of persons that make up the group. Too large group may
not allow for effectiveness participation of all group members
Group Cohesiveness -: this relates to the oneness of the group members. Highly cohesive
group tend to be more energetic in working on group activities, less likely to be absent and
happy about performance. Highly cohesive group could be disadvantageous because of the
effect of “group think” and loss of individuality. Note that the essence of group is to bring
various ideas; where this is not happening; the effectiveness of group performance will
drastically reduce.
Group Composition – These are the people that belong to the group in terms of their
talents, exposure, personality and educational background.
Group Norms– this is about the acceptable behaviour of the group. It can also be regarded
as rules or standard of behaviour that apply to group members.
Decision Making in Groups: Decision making is the process of selecting the course of action
from the various available alternatives
Groups make decision in the following ways:
 Decision by lack of response
 By authority rule
 By minority rule
 By the majority
 By Consensus -: where a clear alternative appears with the support of most
members, and even those who oppose it feel that they have been able to express
their mind.
 By Unanimity -: all group members agree on the course of action to be taken.
5.3.6 Comparison between individual and group decision making
1) The presence of others increases the motivational level of individual performance.
2) Group usually provide more and better solutions to problems than individual working
above- accuracy and quality of judgement.
3) Group learn faster than individuals especially in a classroom situation.
4) More time is used by group in decision making than by individual

1.3 Define mission statement and characteristics
1.4 State the meaning of organizational goals and objectives
1.1 Defining vision and its components
Vision evokes pictures in the mind; it suggests a future orientation. Vision is vital to human
existence.
The future picture (Lynch, 1997): Vision is in the realm of imagination of a favourable future.
Vision is best described by the visioner.
A form of non- specific guidance normally produced for an organization by its CEO (Haggins
& Vineze). It gives an imaginary picture of a preferred future which the leader must carefully
guide the organization to reach.
Vision is also a picture of your company in the future. It is your inspiration, the framework
for all your strategic planning and it is also articulating your dreams and hopes for your
business (Ward, 2010).
Vision again is short, succinct, and inspiring statement of what the organization intends to
become and achieve in the future, often stated in competitive terms. Vision refers to the
category of intentions that are broad, all-inclusive and forward-thinking. It is the image that
a business must have of its goals before it sets out to reach them. It describes aspirations for
the future, without specifying the means that will be used to achieve these desired needs.
Vision can also be defined as the mental images or picture of a preferred future either for
the individual or for an organization; such future is in the realm of imagination which the
visioner must bring into reality with the support of others.
661.1.2 Components of vision
Components of Vision according to Collins & Porras, (1996) can be broadly classified into
two, namely:
Core Ideology
Envisioned future
Core ideology is described as enduring character of an organization-i.e. a consistent identity
that transcends product or market life cycle, technological breakthroughs and the likes. It is
what the organization stands for, the very purpose for which the organization is created.
The core ideology can be further sub-divided into two namely:
Core value i.e. core tenet of the organization, guiding principles, what the organization
stands for. It is a state of belief that is very difficult or impossible to change. It has to do with
the foundation on which the business relationship both to the society and the entire
stakeholders is built. It is the extent of integrity the organization is ready to maintain.
Core purpose: the reason for the organization’s existence, a clear description of the
activities of the organization. Any organization or individual that misses its purpose is not fit
to live; the core purpose must be seen to be achieved. If the purpose is to create an
enduring financial system such organization must be seen to fulfill such purpose.
Envisioned future. It is creative, looking to a future of greatness; it keeps the organization as
well as individual motivated even if the founders are no longer in existence.
o Define vision and list two important component of vision.
 Vision is a form of non- specific guidance normally produced for an organization by
its chief executive officer (CEO). It can also be described as mental images or picture
of a preferred future either for an individual or for an organization; such future is in
the realm of imagination which the visioner must bring into reality with the support
of others. Component of vision include core ideology and envision future.
1.1.3 Importance of Vision and key elements that make leaders with vision succeed
The distinguishing function of a leader is to develop a clear and compelling picture of the
future and to secure commitment to that ideal. In addition to vision, the appropriate
combinations of the following factors indicated in figure 1 below will bring about an
effective organization:
671.1.4 Key elements that make a Leader with vision to succeed
Take personal responsibility for initiating change: The entrepreneur must take personal
responsibility to initiate the necessary change. People resist change; most people see the
negative effect of the change, but as an entrepreneur, one must stay focused and take
charge.
Create a vision and strategy for the organization.
An entrepreneur is the creator of its vision; it is usually first conceived within, and then
expressed in writing, the realization of which requires appropriate strategies to be put in
place for its implementation.
Trust and support others: The entrepreneur cannot realize his vision without others. It is
therefore necessary to ensure that the entrepreneur communicate his/her vision in a very
clear and unambiguous way to elicit the support of others. Since the vision cannot be
realized alone there is need for trust so that none of the members of the organization work
under suspicious condition.
Open yourself for criticism and be ready to adjust. An entrepreneur must be able to subject
the vision to criticism so as to amend and make the vision better. Humility to adjust where
necessary is important.
681.1.5 Visioning Process and way of keeping vision alive
Initiate and provide constant vigilance: Vision must emanate from the leader(s) within the
organization and appropriate vigilance must be ensured to bring the vision to reality. Vision
should be original because if copied from other persons, it may not last particularly when
challenges arise in the process of actualizing the vision.
Set high goals but be realistic: Vision must be challenging in the sense that it must call for
attention such that it will be worth pursuing. Vision must inspire the owner of the vision as
well as those that will be involved in actualizing the vision. Unrealistic goals will result in
frustration; hence vision must be realistic to the extent that those involved will believe its
accomplishment.
Seek significant early involvement by other members of the organization: The sharing of
vision with others give room for criticism so as to make the vision better and robust. The
inputs of others will allow a well conceived vision. If resources have been committed before
involving others it may lead to waste; if the vision could be better actualized with minor
amendments.
Encourage widespread review and comments: Subject your vision to a critical evaluation by
others, allow both positive and negative comments but be careful of destructive comments.
Keep communications flowing: Give room for both vertical and horizontal communication.
All the members of the organization or family members must have something to offer. No
one is the absolute custodian of knowledge
Allow time for the process to work; do not be in a haste to quit your vision. Sleep over your
vision before you get started.
Demonstrate commitment, follow through: Vision is lonely; demonstrate your commitment
and encourage the commitment of the organization members. You must lead others to
follow your vision through. If you abandon it no one can revive it but you. So do not quit
your vision, a quitter never wins and winners never quit.
Maintain harmony of sub-units: Ensure the different units of the organization work in
harmony. No unit is allowed to work at variance with one another, that is, it must be a
unified vision.
1.1.6 Ways of keeping Vision alive
Honour and live the vision as the organization’s constitution. The vision is not a document
prepared and hung in the office. The culture and value of the organization must take its root
from the vision.
Encourage new members’ understanding and commitment through early introduction.
New members of the organization must be taught and understand the aspiration of the
organization.
Make it constantly visible. Let the attitude of the leaders always reflect the organizational
vision. The decision making process must be in line with the organization vision, so that all
members of the organization are constantly aware that it is the organizational vision that is
directing the activities within the organization.
Create integrity through alignment and congruency – decision making patterns, personnel
policies etc must be in line with the vision.
Review the vision periodically, revising as appropriate to reflect changing conditions.
o List how you will ensure your vision is brought into reality
691.1.7 Tips to making the vision a Reality and evaluation of vision
 Vision must be developed by leaders, those who have the strength and influence to
establish direction and mobilize the organization members and resources.
 Empower people at all levels by articulating your vision, agree on clear goals and
objectives and give them the authority they need to be entrepreneurial in finding
ways of achieving their goals.
 A vision must be communicated to followers and must be supported by them.
Leaders must market their vision clear to the followers.
 Remove fear of unknown and fear of failure in your words and actions.
 Stay focused on the key strategic goals despite all the day-to-day distractions.
 Create a working environment that encourages creativity and innovation.
 Allow people time for exploration and discovery in addition to normal work.
 Make the vision comprehensive and detailed so that every member of the
organization can understand his or her part in bringing the vision to reality.
 Invest in employee training and coaching. Help them to develop entrepreneurial and
creative skills.
 A vision must be uplifting and inspiring.
 Plan for success but give room for failure.
1.1.8 Evaluation of vision – The following are some of the evaluation criteria:-
 Foresight
 Broadness of vision
 Uniqueness of vision
 Consensus of vision
 Practicality of vision
 Accessibility of vision
o How important is vision in entrepreneurial process?
 Vision is very central in entrepreneurial process as it is the mental picture of the
better future that propel the entrepreneur to give all it takes to bring the future
dreams into reality by creating venture, work tirelessly to ensure it success and
eventually reaping gains/benefits.
1.2 Mission Statement
We have said that vision is a mental picture of a preferred future; it is essentially futuristic,
and forward looking view of what an organization intends to become. Mission on the other
hand is what an organization is and the reason for its existence. A meaningful mission must
specifically state the fundamental and unique reason for its being and how it is different
from other corporate organizations. Pearce II & Robinson Jr., (2004) defined mission as the
fundamental, unique purpose that sets a business apart from other firms of its type and
identifies the scope of its operations in product and market terms. Mission gives specific
701.2.1 Characteristics of Mission Statement
Kazim (2004) identified seven characteristics of effective mission statement as follows:
It should be visible: A mission should always aim high but it should not be an impossible
statement. It should be realistic and achievable.
It should be precise: mission statement should not be too narrow to restrict organization
activities and it should not be too broad to make it meaningless giving no direction.
It should be clear: Mission statement should be clearly stated to the extent that it can lead
the organization into definite action.
It should be motivating: Mission statement must be motivating to the employees and
society. It must delight the stakeholders to enable it achieve the embodiments of the
statements.
It should be distinctive: Mission statement should be unique to each organization and
differentiate it from similar organizations.
It should indicate major components of strategy: which are long-range, decisions, plans,
mission, goals, objectives, options, resources allocation, resource utilization, process and
advantages improvement
It should indicate how objectives are to be accomplished in terms of concrete specific
targets defined for mission derived goals (Adeleke, Ogundele & Oyenuga, 2008).
o Explain the importance of Mission statement
 Mission statement is the reason for the organization existence; it is unique purposes
that differentiate one business from the other. Mission statement gives direction
and focus to organization
1.3 Organizational goals and objectives
1.3.1 Organizational goals
Kazim (2004) defined goals as what an organization hopes to accomplish in a future period
of time. They represent a future state or an outcome of the effort put in now. A broad
category of financial and non-financial issues are addressed by the goals that an
organization sets for itself. Goals and objectives are often used interchangeably; the major
difference has to do with the fact that goals are considered broader than objectives. Goals
can be stated in broad terms such as marketing goals, financial goals, and production goals.
When these goals are broken down to reflect specific, measurable and timing of their
accomplishment, they then become objectives.
711.3.2 Organizational Objectives
Objective is described in Olayiwola (2007) as specific intended results of organization
activities. Kazim (2004) sees objective as the ends that state specifically how the goals shall
be achieved. Objectives are concrete and specific in contrast to goals which are generalized;
objectives make the goals operational. While goals may be qualitative, objectives tend to be
mainly quantitative in specification, thus making objectives measurable and comparable.
1.3.3 Importance of objectives
Objectives are vital to the survival of organization especially in the area of unifying different
sections and harmonization of different interests. Objectives are important for the following
reasons:-
To provide directions for the organization.
It allows the organization to relate effectively and efficiently with its environment
It aids decision making
It allows the organization to pursue its vision and mission
It allows resources to be effectively and efficiently allocated among competing needs.
It provides the standard for performance evaluation.
To establish a basis for control.
1.3.4 Characteristics of good objectives
Since objectives are important tools to measure and evaluate organizational performance, it
is important for such tool to possess certain characteristics such as:-
 Clear and understandable by all the stakeholders
 It should be concise, specific and direct
 It must be measurable in quantitative or qualitative terms
 It must have a time horizon which must be clearly stated within which objective
must be accomplished
 It must be challenging and attainable
 There must be harmony among different objectives
 Prioritizing of objectives where resources available are inadequate to pursue
multiple objectives at the same time.
o Why should an entrepreneurial organization have clearly stated objectives?
 Objectives are the specific intended results of organization. When objectives are
clearly stated, they provide clear direction, aid decision making, allow organization
to pursue its vision and mission, provide effective ways of allocating resources and
enable organization to relate effectively with its environmen

2.7 List other regulatory agencies
2.1 Business Regulatory/Legal Roles
In every society, social and business activities are guided by certain laid down principles.
Such principles emphasis acceptable manners of conduct among the community members.
Similarly the regulatory/legal environment prescribes acceptable principles and guides in
business relationship such that each party understands the requirement of the business
relationship and that each party will conduct business activities in accordance with the laws
of the land. There are three levels of regulations in Nigeria namely:
 The Federal Legislation acts
 The State legislation laws
 Local Government by laws
742.2 Government and Business Regulatory Agencies/Bodies
There are many aspects of regulatory and monitoring roles of government. In order to
effectively carry out these roles, government has established different agencies/bodies with
the appropriate legislative backings to ensure business operations are conducted in a
friendly business environment. Some of the agencies and their functions include:-
2.2.1 The Corporate Affairs Commission
The Corporate Affairs Commission was established by the Companies and Allied Matters Act
(CAMA) 1990 as a corporate body with perpetual succession and a common seal; it is
capable of suing and being sued in its corporate name. The headquarters of the
Commission was to be based at Abuja the Federal Capital Territory.
Functions of the CAC
The Act that established the Commission specified the following functions:
 The regulation and supervision of the formation, incorporation, registration,
management, and winding up of companies.
 Establishing and maintaining companies’ registry and offices in all the states of the
Federation suitably and adequately equipped to discharge its formations.
 Arrange or conduct an investigation into the affairs of any company where the
interests of the shareholders and the public so demand.
 Perform such other functions as may be specified by any act or enactment.
 Undertake such activities as one necessary or expedient for giving full effect to the
provisions of the Act (CAMA, 1990).
752.2.2. National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC)
NAFDAC was established under decree No 15 of 1993.The decree vested in it dual functions.
To see to the establishment of food beverages and cream industry
As well as regulating and controlling the importation, manufacturing, distribution, sales and
use of processed food, drugs, cosmetics, medical devices, bottled water, chemicals and
advertisements relating to food, beverages and cream products.

water and chemicals.
Compile standard specifications and guidelines for production, importation, sales and
distributions of processed foods, drugs, cosmetics, medical devices, bottled water and
chemicals.
Inspect all imported and locally made processed foods, drugs, chemicals, cosmetics, medical
devices, bottled water, and establish relevant quality assurance systems.
2.2.3 The Standard Council
According to Ogundele, (2007), the body was established as Nigerian Standard Organization
Act of 1971, now Standard Organization of Nigeria (SON). The functions of the council
include:
 To advise government on standards, standard specifications, control and
methodology.
 Designating, establishing and approving standard in respect of metrology,
materials, commodities, products, processes for the certification of products in
commerce and industry throughout Nigeria.

conformity with standard specifications.
 Awarding of certificate marks by the council to the manufacturers whose
products meet Council’s established standards
 Sealing up and confiscating of assets of organizations that fail to live up to the
standards set.
2.2.4 The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC)
The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission was established
as a corporate body by the Federal Government of Nigeria as a legislative initiative to
combat corruption which has become endemic in the national life. The commission
comprises high police ranking officers, legal practitioners with at least 10 years post-call
experience, retired judge of a superior court of law, a retired public servant not below the
rank of a director, a woman, a youth not less than 21 or more than 30 years of age at the
time of his or her appointment and a chartered accountant. The ICPC mandate was to
prohibit and prescribe punishment for corrupt practices and other related offences.
762.2.5 The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC)
The EFCC was established by Act of parliament in 2004 and the Commission was
empowered by the Act to carry out the following function which can be found in part two of
the Act:
Functions of the Commission
The Commission according to the Act shall be responsible for -
(a) The enforcement and the due administration of the provisions of this Act;
772.3 Other Regulatory Agencies
Other agencies that are involved in regulatory and supportive roles are isted below
 Governing Council of National Office of Industrial Property
 Productivity Prices and Income Board
 The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)
 Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE)
 Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
792.4 Promotional/Supportive Roles of Government
Without mincing words, in defining the role of government supporting entrepreneurship
and SMEs, it is obvious that apart from designing a comprehensive entrepreneurship and
SMEs strategy, the development of national SME support institutions and networks is one of
the key conditions for success. Although a number of agencies have been established in the
past to strengthen the SMEs, it is generally believed that the government needs to do more.
The following are typical ways by which government promotes and supports entrepreneur
Discuss the various ways government promotes and supports entrepreneurship
 Tax Holiday: A tax holiday is a temporary reduction or elimination of tax;
governments usually create tax holidays as incentives for business investment. The
taxes that are most commonly reduced by national and local governments are sales
taxes, company income tax etc. Tax holiday is a kind of incentive used to encourage
the growth and development of business enterprises.
 Financial incentive: These schemes are one form of strategic assistance an
organization may be able to access from the government or agencies. These high
level schemes focus on projects that will achieve real productivity improvements -
particularly those that will assist collaboration among firms in research, technology
diffusion, business transformation and capacity building within the defined sectors
e.g. agricultural sector, manufacturing sector etc.
 Infrastructural development: These are basic facilities that will enhance
productivity, reduce cost if they are centrally provided by the government. These
items include constant electric supply, portable water, good road facilities, efficient
communication system etc. The lack of basic infrastructural facilities has been
responsible for low economic activities particularly in the manufacturing sectors in
Nigeria.
802.5. The Objectives of government Regulation
 To ensure the development of healthy balance between private and public
ownership
 To make use of equal opportunity for cooperation
 To ensure utilization of the existing capacity and the creation of economy of scale
 To avoid the creation of natural monopolies
 To promote a more equitable distribution of income and a wider ownership of
business enterprises within and among nationals
 To develop data base or data bank in business activity
 To raise revenue for purpose of financing other social, economic and political
objective defined by the government
 To promote general pattern of distribution
 To raise the living standards of Nigerians
 To regulate by-laws and taxation with a view to equating the private and social costs.
2.6. Strategic importance of SMEs
Parallel with ownership reform and privatization, the number of SMEs is increasing. The
strategic importance of SMEs is today acknowledged around the world for the following
reasons according to Sunje, www.unece.org/indust/sme/ece-sme.htm. Small and medium-
sized enterprises are contributing to employment growth at a higher rate than larger firms.
In the EU economy about 99.9 per cent of the enterprises are SMEs, of which 93 per cent
are micro enterprises. In 1992, there were 15.7 million SMEs.
SMEs in the private non-primary (i.e. non-farming) sector of the Community; the private
sector and in particular SMEs form the backbone of a market economy and for the transition
economies in the long-term might provide most of the employment (as is the case in the EU
countries). A World Bank sector policy paper shows that their labour intensity is from 4-10
times higher for small enterprises;
Support for SMEs will help the restructuring of large enterprises by streamlining
manufacturing complexes as units with no direct relation to the primary activity. And
through this process the efficiency of the remaining enterprise might be increased as well;
They curb the monopoly of the large enterprises and offer them complementary services
and absorb the fluctuation of a modern economy;

2,3,"This study session introduces you to how to write a business plan and feasibility studies. The
business plan is like the life plan for an individual. Before you begin writing your business
plan you need to identify how, where, and to whom you intend to sell a product or provide
a service. You also need to assess your competitive environment and understand how much
money you need to start your business and keep it running until it is established. Feasibility
studies will be required to address things like where and how the business will operate.
They provide comprehensive details about the business to determine if and how it can
succeed, and serve as a valuable tool for developing a good business plan.","module 2 study session 3

3.2 Discuss feasibility studies and its importance
3.3 Explain the components of feasibility studies.
3.4 Discuss business plan.
3.5 Explain the need for and benefits of business plan.
3.1 Feasibility studies and its importance
Feasibility studies comprise comprehensive, detailed information about ones’ business
structure, the products and services, the market, logistics of how one will actually deliver a
product or service, the resources one needs to make the business run effectively, as well as
other information about the business (Women in Business, 2010). A Business Feasibility
Study can also be defined as a controlled process for identifying problems and
opportunities, determining objectives, describing situations, defining successful
outcomes, and assessing the range of costs and benefits associated with several
alternatives for solving a problem (Thompson, 2005).
The importance of Feasibility Studies: According to Women in Business (2010), the
information you gather and present in your feasibility study will help you:
It serves as the standard or yardstick for assessing performance of envisaged business. It
also helps to:
 List in detail all the things you need to make the business work;
 Identify logistical and other business-related problems and solutions;
 Develop marketing strategies to convince a bank or investor that your
business is worth considering as an investment; and
 Serve as a solid foundation for developing your business plan.
 Provides important information necessary for accurate decision making in
relation to proposed project. Even if you have a great business idea you still
have to find a cost-effective way to market and sell your products and
863.1.1 Components of Feasibility Studies
Executive Summary: The Executive Summary is a summary of all key sections of the
Business Feasibility Study and should work as a separate, stand alone document. Key

completed. Although the Executive Summary is written last, it is presented first. The
Executive Summary should be no more than one page long
Product/Service: Describe the enterprises, product at service in simple language. It
describes how customers would use and buy the product or service.
Technology: As necessary, provide further technical information about the product or
service. It describes additional or ongoing research and development needs.
Intended Market Environment
Target Market:
Define and describe the target market(s).
Distinguish between end users and customers.
For business-to-business markets, include:
What industry is the target market, who is the key players, frequency of product
purchase, replacement needs versus expansion, purchasing process?
For business-to-consumer markets, include: Demographic factors, such as income
level, age range, gender, educational level, and ethnicity.
Competition

margins.
Production / operating requirements: Describe enough of how and where the enterprise
will manufacture, source or create and deliver the final product or service to be able to
estimate costs. Will space be owned or leased? Will renovations be required? At what
cost?
873.2 Business plan and its importance
The term “business plan” has different meanings to different people. Banks that release
their own planning guidlines consider formal business loan applications to be synonymous
with business plans. Venture capitalists see them as investment proposals, purely fund
raising documents. Corporate managers think of them in terms of departmental budgets
and financial forecasts.(Touchie, 2005).
According to Kuratko and Hodgetts (1998), the business plan describes to investors and
financial sources all of the events that are likely to affect the proposed venture. Details are
required for various projected actions of the venture, with associated revenues and costs
outlined. A Business Plan describes a business opportunity. It is like a road map because it
tells you what to expect and what alternative routes you can take to arrive at your
destination. Planning helps you to work smarter rather than harder. It keeps you future-
oriented and motivates you to achieve the results you want. Perhaps most importantly, the
process of completing a Business Plan enables you to determine what commitment you
need to make to the venture (Department of Trade and Economic Development, 2010)
3.2 1 Importance of Business Plan
When you think about what a business plan isyour mind probably goes right to the bank and
the process of applying for business financing, as that is the most common use for business
plans. But if you are creating this valuable tool only as a part of a required financing
package, you are overlooking its most important function: planning (Cagan, 2006). Whether
you are new to the world of entrepreneurship or a seasoned veteran, a properly crafted
business plan can help solidify your vision. And when you are remaking an on-going venture,
a written strategy (business plan) can help ensure its success. Taking cognizance of that,
there are particular events that spur the need for a full-scale business plan. According to
Cagan (2006), they include the following:
 You plan to launch a new business.
 Your business has grown substantially.
 You want to expand your existing business into new markets.
 You want to add a new product or product line.
 You are thinking about buying a business.
Other reasons why business plan is necessary according to Department of Trade and
Economic Development (2010) are to:
 Control future risks
 Prepare for future uncertainty
 Control business environment
 Control business growth
 Avoid sales crises
 Avoid liquidity crises
 Avoid succession crises
 Ensure people development
 Ensure work space available
 Avoid stock buying crises
893.3. Principles of Planning in Feasibility Studies and Business Plan
A plan must be:
Explicit: All steps completely spelled out.
Intelligible: Capable of being understood by those who will carry it out.
Flexible: Capable of accepting change.
Written: Committed to writing in a clear and concise manner.
Benefits of Planning
1. Reduces ‘firefighting’: Many small business owners spend so much time ‘putting out the
fires’ that they never have a chance to do anything else. By preparing a Business Plan you
can anticipate problems that are likely to occur and decide how they should be handled in
advance.
2. Justifies your plans and actions: Often, one decides to do something because it ‘sounds’
or ‘feels’ right. You may do something because that is the way that you have always done it.
Preparing a Business Plan forces you to prove the validity, or at least consider the reasoning
of your plans.
3. Tests your ideas on paper: It is much better to produce a Business Plan and find that the
business is likely to be unprofitable than to start the business and find out the same thing.
4. Indicates your ability and commitment: A well-prepared Business Plan is an impressive
document. It shows outsiders such as lenders and suppliers that you understand the
business.
3.4 Components of a written plan
A written Business Plan should contain the following:
1. The Business Idea: An outline and description of the product or service and background
on the industry.
2. The Entrepreneurs: A history of the founders of the business including their skills, abilities
and proposed ownership structure.
3. Business Objectives:
· What the business intends to achieve including long range goals
· The advantage of the product or service over existing competitors
· The image and character of the business to be developed.

ways of raising capital for your business. It is not only for a business that is just starting up
but also for an existing business. Apart from funds acquisition, management of funds in
business is also reflected in the study.","module 2 study session 4
At the end module 2 study session 4 you should be able to","4.1 Define and explain correctly all the key words in bold
4.2 Explain the criteria for acquisition and allocation of funds
4.3 List and explain the personal and family sources of funds
4.4 Define internal sources of fund
4.5 Identify the different classifications of external sources of funds
4.6 Explain the basic requirements for seeking a loan facility
4.7 Recognize how small and medium enterprises are funded in Nigeria
4.8 Identify the challenges of small and medium scale enterprises.
4.1 Acquisition and allocation of funds
Acquisition and allocation of funds is central to the success of any business venture. One of
the main problems facing effective management of small scale enterprises is lack of basic
financial management skills needed to guide the business venture. These skills include the
ability to keep appropriate records of financial transactions, financial control, credit
management, risk management, personal financial discipline of the entrepreneur and
inability to see the business as separate from the owners. For a business venture to
externally raise capital needed for its operation the financial institutions require a level of
minimum compliance with the basic issues raised above. In addition, it is important that the
entrepreneur avoid under or over estimation of the capital requirements for its operations,
otherwise too large capital will lead to unnecessary high costs and inadequate capital will
affect the growth of the business venture.
The United States (US) Small Business Administration (SBA) suggested the need for
entrepreneur to answer the following questions so as to realistically determine the volume
of capital needed for its operations:-
 Why do I need the capital?: -
 How much do I need?
 When do I need it?
 For how long will I need it?
 Where can I obtain it?
 How can I repay it?
954.2. Sources of funds for venture operation
Money is needed to operate and grow or expand a business. Business may need money to
purchase equipment, inventory, create awareness, restructure or even renovation to be
properly positioned to handle challenges. It is often a great challenge for new business
ventures to find or accumulate the needed fund to commence or expand operation.
Financing is the use and manipulation of money. Raising money for a business is one aspect
of financing. There are different forms of raising funds open to the entrepreneurs. These
sources vary in terms of the volume of fund that can be accessed, the cost of the funds and
the security required to obtain the funds. The choice of individual entrepreneur will be
determined by the following as suggested by (Olannye & Oyibi, 2002)
 Knowing the number of sources of funds available
 Risk involve
 The duration of financing whether it is short term or long term.
 The cost of borrowing from each source
 Government restrictions and institutional constraints
 The value and nature of assets as security or collateral
The various sources of funds for business ventures are classified under the following:
The Personal and family sources
The Internal sources
The External sources
4.2.1 The Personal and family
This source of finance is peculiar to a new venture, although it may also be applicable to an
existing venture particularly loans from friends and relations as explained below
Personal savings: - It is expected that an individual that wants to start a business should be
able to have saved part of the funds required for the business. This is necessary because
relying on borrowed funds may be too dangerous for a new venture. It is also a way of
motivating the owner to know that if the venture fails the life saving will be lost.
Loan from family and friends: - Family members often want to support other family
members venturing into business, hence part of the venture funds are contributed in form
of loans or gifts. Also, friends support through loans and sometimes gifts to encourage their
friend that is starting a business.
964.2.2 Internal Sources
An internal source of funds is peculiar to an existing venture. The internally generated funds
can emanate from the following sources
Retained profits: - It is an accepted practice to finance the fixed and working capital
requirement from profits generated from the previous business activities of the venture.
Provisions: - Provision for tax and depreciation are another internal source of finance. Since
business tax are payable a year after profits have been declared, this amount could serve as
a source of fund for small business firm. Furthermore, annual provisions for depreciation
represent cash retained by the enterprise over and above the normal undistributed profit.
Reducing current asset: - Reducing current assets is a source of fund and large amount of
money could be made available for financing the activities of the venture.
4.2.3 External Sources
The external sources of funds are those that are obtained outside the venture. The external
sources can be sub-divided into three namely; -
 Short- term finance
 Medium term finance
 Long term finance
A Short term finance: Short term financing involves obligation debts that have maturity
date of less than one year. The typical example of short term finance includes goods
purchased on credits, outstanding short term loans from banks/ accrued payment such as
deferred taxation, salaries and wages etc. Some of the methods of short term financing are;
-
(i) Open account or Trade credits/ Account payable: - It is a form of financing in which the
seller extends credits to customers. The credit is reflected on the entrepreneur’s balance
sheet as accounts payable, and in most cases it must be paid in 30 to 90 days.
(ii) Account receivable financing: - It is a short term financing that involves either the pledge
of receivables as collateral for a loan or the sale of receivables (factoring). Accounts
receivables loans are made by banks, whereas factoring is done primarily by finance
companies and factoring concerns.
(iii) Bank overdraft facilities: - An arrangement which allows a person who keep a current
account with a bank the opportunity to draw above the balance in the account. The
customers who overdraws his/her account pays both the overdrawn account plus the
interest on the amount overdrawn.
(IV) Notes payable: - These are payments to banks (commercial) individuals or firms in
which the maker of such notes endorses them in favour of the payee. A typical example of
notes payable is a promissory note which is a short term marketable debt security in which
the borrower promises to pay a stated sum on a stated future date, also known as one-
name paper or commercial paper.
(V) Commercial draft: - It is a short term credit instrument, it is similar to a promissory note,
except that the payee creates the draft in which the drawer indicates the time on the draft
or sight draft requiring payment on presentation.
971.0 billion to N25.0 billion will now enable the sectors play its
pivotal role of supporting the growth SMEs in Nigeria.
The cumulative loans granted by DMBs to the economy from 1992-2001 amounted to
3,031,226.1 million or 3,031 trillion. Of the total amount, accumulated loans to SMEs during
the period of ten years, 1992-2001 accounted for N426,826.8 million (N426.8 billion or 14%)
while other sectors took the lion share of N2,604.4 billion (or 86%0 during the same period
(Raw Material Research and Development Council Publication 2005).

From the above, it is easy to pinpoint that the commercial banks as one of the most viable
sectors of the banking industry has performed grossly below expectation in the
disbursement of loans to the small and medium enterprises. This could be as a result of the
following:
 High interest rates
 Lack of collateral
 Poor track record
 Low level of education
 Poor business proposals
994.3. Reasons why entrepreneurs will require Loan facilities
From our discussion so far you will agree with me that potential, new and existing
entrepreneurs need loan to start or enlarge the volume of their operations in one way or
the other. Generally entrepreneurs will require credit facilities for the following reasons:-
Normal operations: - An entrepreneur/small business owner may have to borrow part of
the money to run the business, especially when fund available is not sufficient to profitably
run the business venture.
Expansion purpose: - If the business intends to expand existing operation or acquire some
highly sophisticated equipment, such business may be required to look outward to raise
needed funds.
Financial difficulties: There may arise some financial difficulties as a result of general
economic depressions which may require business venture to seek financial assistance from
any of the sources already discussed. In addition, accumulation of high bad debts,
temporary losses from operations and some more fundamental problems may cause a
business to look outward for its finance.
 Mention three reasons why an entrepreneur requires a credit facility as suggested
above.

5.1 Philosophical basis of business ethics
The British philosopher Bertand Russell has influenced ethical thinking in recent decades. A
vigorous critic of conventional morality, he held the view that moral judgments express
individual desires or accepted habits. In his thinking, both the ascetic saint and the detached
sage are poor human models because they are incomplete human beings. Complete human
beings participate fully in the life of society and express all of their nature. Some impulses
must be checked in the interests of society and others in the interest of individual
1045.2 An Overview of Concepts in Business Ethics
Philosophy of business is used to determine the fundamental purposes of a company. If a
company’s main purpose is to maximize the returns to its shareholders, then it could be
seen as unethical for a company to consider the interests and rights of anyone else.
Corporate social responsibility details the ethical rights and duties existing between
companies and the host society.
1055.2.1 Corporate Ethics Policies
Many companies have formulated internal policies pertaining to the ethical conduct of
employees. These policies can be simple exhortations in broad, highly-generalized language
(typically called a corporate ethics statement), or they can be more detailed policies,
containing specific behavioral requirements (typically called corporate ethics codes). They
are generally meant to identify the company’s expectations of workers and to offer
guidance on handling some of the more common ethical problems that might arise in the
course of doing business. It is hoped that having such a policy will lead to greater ethical
awareness, consistency in application, and the avoidance of ethical disasters.
An increasing number of companies also require employees to attend seminars regarding
business conduct, which often include discussion of the company’s policies, specific case
studies, and legal requirements. Some companies even require their employees to sign
agreement stating that they will abide by the company’s rules of conduct.
Many companies are assessing the environmental factors that can lead employees to
engage in unethical conduct. Not everyone supports corporate policies that govern ethical
conduct. Some claim that ethical problems are better dealt with by depending upon
employees to use their own judgments.
Others believe that corporate ethics policies are primarily rooted in utilitarian concerns, and
that they are mainly to limit the company’s legal liability or to curry public favour by giving
the appearance of being a good corporate citizen. Ideally, the company will avoid lawsuit
because its employees will follow the rules. Should a lawsuit occur, the company can claim
that the problem would not have arisen if the employee had only followed the code
properly?
Sometimes there is disconnection between the company’s code of ethics and the company’s
actual practices. Thus, whether or not such conduct is explicitly sanctioned by management,
at worst, this makes the policy duplications, and at best, it is merely a marketing tool. To be
successful, most ethicists would suggest that an ethics policy should be given the
unequivocal support of top management, by both word and example, explained in writing
and orally, with periodic reinforcement. It must be something employees can both
understand and perform. It should be monitored by top management, with routine
inspections for compliance and improvements and backed up by clearly stated
consequences in the case of disobedience. It must also remained neutral and nonsexist
5.3 International Business Ethics
While business ethnics emerged as a field in the 1970s, international business ethics did not
emerge until the late 1990s, looking back on the international developments of that decade.
Many new practical issues arose out of the international context of business. Theoretical
issues such as cultural relativity of ethical values receive more emphasis in this field. Other
older issues can be grouped here as well. Issues and subfields include:
 The search for universal values as a basis for international commercial behavior.
1065.4 Importance of Business Ethics
Although most contemporary philosophy is highly technical and inaccessible to non-
specialists, some contemporary philosophers concern themselves with practical questions
and strive to influence today’s business culture. For instance, practitioners of feminist
philosophy, environmental philosopher, and some areas of contemporary political
philosophy seek to use the tools of philosophy to resolve current issues directly related to
peoples’ lives within those context. Separate areas of specialization, such as biomedical
ethics and business ethics, have emerged within applied ethics. Biomedical ethics deals with
questions arising from the life sciences and human healthcare and has two subspecialties:
bioethics and medical ethics. Bioethicists study the ethical implications of advances in
genetics and biotechnology, such as genetic testing, genetic privacy, cloning and new
reproductive technologies. For example, they consider the consequences for individuals
who learn they have inherited fatal genetic diseases, or the consequences of technology
that enables parents to choose the sex of a baby. Bioethicists then offer advice to
legislators, researchers, and physicians active in these areas. Specialists in medical ethics
offer advice to physicians, other health care personnel, and patients on a wide variety of
issues, including abortion, euthanasia, fertility treatments, medical confidentiality and the
allocation of scarce medical resources. Much of the work in medical ethnics directly affects
the everyday practice of medicine, and most nursing students and medical students now
take course in this field.
Business ethicists bring ethical theories and techniques to bear on moral issues that arise in
business. For example, what are the responsibilities of corporations to their employees,
their customers, their shareholders and the environment? Most business students take
courses in business ethics and many large corporations regularly consult with specialists in
1075.4.1 Necessity of ethics in Business and society
There are several reasons why ethics is necessary in business namely:
To enhance competition: ethics enhance competition when standards are adhered to, for
example the ethics of hardwork, thrift, frugality and self-improvement were responsible for
the industrial revolusion of the 18th century.
To preserve legitimacy: if a company produces illegitimate products that is claiming the
values which they do not have, it will have to struggle to keep them in the market. A
company, therefore, cannot afford to let the legitimacy of its products come into question.
To deter white-collar crime: these include offences such as petty theft, taking sick leave
when a person is not sick, getting paid for overtime not worked, faking injury to receive
compensation, taking care of personal business at the expense of company time, taking
kick-back from suppliers and big time crimes in corporations and ministries.
To promote trust: ethics matter in promoting trust and preventing debilitating contacts.
Successful company management, employees and shareholders build on network of trust,
that binds management, employees and shareholders. Issues of fairness and division of
spoils can divide a company and make it difficult to function and it can ruin an organization
(Ogundele 2011).
 Business ethics is unnecessary as long as an entrepreneur can maximize profit Discuss
 Business ethics is very necessary in order to maintain healthy competition, preserve
legitimacy, deter white-collar crime, and promote trust.
 Why is ethics necessary for business and society.(ITQ)
5.5 Ethics of economic system defined
This vaguely defined area, perhaps not part of but only related to business ethics, is where
business ethicists venture into the field of political economy and political philosophy,
focusing on the rights and wrongs of various systems for the distribution of economic
benefits.
5.5.1 Conflicting interests
Business ethics can be examined from various perspectives, including the perspective of the
employee, the commercial enterprise, and society as a whole. Very often, situations arise in
which there is conflict between one or more of the parties, such that serving the interest of
one party is detriment to the other(s). For example, a particular outcome might be good for
the employee, whereas, it would be bad for the company, society or vice versa. Some
ethicists see the principal role of ethics as the harmonization and reconciliation of
conflicting interests. Controversial views on ethics are based on the following arguements
against ethical behaviour by entrepreneurs:
1. That business and entrepreneurship is concerned with economic sector not ethical issues
and should be judged on the basis of economic performance.
1085.5.2 Ethical issues and approaches in different economic systems
Philosophers and others disagree about the purpose of a business ethic in society. For
example, some suggest that the principal purpose of a business is to maximize returns to its
owners, or in the case of a publicly-traded concern, its shareholders. Thus, under this view,
only those activities that increase profitability and shareholder value should be encouraged,
because any others function as a tax on profits. Some believe that the only companies that
are likely to survive in a competitive marketplace are those that place profit maximization
above everything else. However, some point out that self-interest would still require a
business to obey the law and adhere to basic moral rules, because the consequences of
failing to do so could be very costly in fines, loss of license or company reputation. The
noted economist Milton Friedman was a leading proponent of this view.
Other theorists contend that a business has moral duties that extend well beyond serving
the interests of its owners or stockholders, and that these duties consist of more than
simply obeying the law. They believe a business has moral responsibilities to so-called
stakeholders, people who have an interest in the conduct of the business, which might
include employees, customers, vendors, the local community or even society as a whole.
They would say that stakeholders have certain rights with regard to how the business
operates, and some would suggest that this includes even rights of governance.
Some theorists have adapted social contract theory to business, whereby companies
become quasi-democratic associations, and employees and other stakeholders are g-iven
voice over a company’s operations. It posits that conflicting interests are best resolved by
formulating a “fair agreement” between the parties, using a combination of 1) macro-

Nigerian entrepreneurs. This is important because the Nigerian entrepreneurs, unlike their
counterparts in other parts of the world, face challenges that are peculiar only to the
Nigerian business environment. Also opportunities exist that have not been tapped in the
Nigerian business environment. Thus, to be able to survive and compete successfully in the
global market, the Nigerian entrepreneur needs to do a thorough SWOT (Strengths,
Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis and so has to sharpen their knack for
recognizing good opportunities as they emerge in the business environment (Miranda,
2010).","module 3 study session 1

1.1 An Overview of The evolution of Contemporary Nigeria
Nigeria is a country strategically located in the west coast of Africa. Nigeria sits on the Gulf
of Guinea sandwiched to the north by Niger, the east by Cameroon and the west by Benin.
Nigeria is so strategically located that foreign companies located in the country market their
products from Nigeria to other neighboring countries like Benin Republic, Cameroon, Chad,
Congo, Gabon, Ghana, Mali, and Niger. The present-day Nigeria was amalgamated by the
British in 1914. Prior to then, Nigeria existed in parts as the Northern protectorate, Southern
protectorate and Lagos Colony. These structures were created in consonance with the
desires of the local people and convenience of the British colonial government. Nigeria
gained its independence in 1960, after about 60 years of British rule. Since independence
the internal political structure have changed severally first from a three region structure to
twelve states created in 1967. In 1976 it was further divided into 19 states. Presently the
country has a total of 36 states and a federal capital in Abuja (African Ventures, 2003; Dixon-
Ogbechi, 2003).
1131.2 Development of Entrepreneurship in Nigeria
Though the evolution of entrepreneurship can be simply traced to the advent of trade by
barter system, modern entrepreneurship in Nigeria started with colonialization. These
colonialists brought in foreign products and used Nigerians as their middlemen. Mostly,
these middlemen were retailers or sole proprietors. , The growth of entrepreneurship in
1141.3 Entrepreneurship versus Social Entrepreneurship
Entrepreneurship is simply the creation of a new business. A business is any undertaking
that produces goods and services that satisfy human needs and wants. Thus, any business
that fails to satisfy the needs of the society within which it operates cannot survive because
the society is made up of people who will consume its products/services. Most businesses
1151.4 Notable Nigerian Entrepreneurs and Social Entrepreneurs: An
Overview
Some notable Nigerian entrepreneurs are:
1.4.1 Aliko Dangote
This Nigerian entrepreneur was born in 1957. He created the Dangote Group and is
considered to be one of the richest men in Africa. The Dangote group is a big organization
that is into export, import, manufacturing, real estate and philanthropy. Some of the
products it deals with are: spaghetti, macaroni, sugar, salt, rice textile materials, while the
Group is also into transportation, packaging, and even security. The Dangote Group imports
sugar, rice, fish, and cement, fertilizer and building materials. While it exports cotton, cocoa,
cashew nuts, sesame seed, ginger and gum. Aliko Dangote has contributed tremendously to
the economic development of Nigeria and has greatly assisted in reducing the rate of
unemployment in the country by providing employment to Nigerian graduates and even
other categories of labour (Africansuccess.org, 2008; Nairaland.com, 2010).
1161.4.2 Chidi Anyaegbu
This entrepreneur is regarded as ‘King’ of the transport industry. He founded the Chisco
Transport Limited which is one of the biggest in the Nigerian transport industry. Over the
years, Chisco Transport Limited grew to become the Chisco Group. The Chisco group is into
variety of businesses such as: oil and gas, finance, hospitality, real estate, import and export.
Apart from this he has also contributed tremendously to the development of the nation
through various philanthropic activities. For instance, he established a foundation to take
care of his philanthropic interests and also built a Faculty of Business building for Transport
Studies at the Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka (Prince Society, 2009; Nairaland.com, 2010;
Onyima, 2010)
1.4.3 Chris Ejiofor
This is an entrepreneur in the importation and marketing of car or auto batteries. He
established Dimaps Batteries and has written extensively about usage and maintenance of
batteries in Nigeria.
1.4.4 Mike Adenuga Junior
This entrepreneur was born in 1953. He has business in various industries such as banking,
oil and telecommunications. He owns the Consolidated Oil Company, which is the first
indigenous company to strike crude in December 1991. Consolidated Oil Company is into
crude oil drilling, refining and marketing. He also owns the Equatorial Trust Bank and
created one of the main telecommunications companies in Nigeria (Globacom), against all
odds. Globacom Limited was created after he failed to penetrate the telecommunications
industry in 1999 with his first telecommunications company- Communications Investment
Limited, (CIL) because his conditional license was revoked. However, in 2002 he won the bid
for the Second National Operator (SNO) license. This was a better strategic business option
for him because the SNO has a wider range of operations and this gave Globacom the right
to serve as international gateway for telecommunications in Nigeria and also operate: digital
mobile lines, fixed wireless access phones and also operate as a national carrier. This
entrepreneur was able to achieve these entrepreneurial successes because he has a unique
flair for risks and tenacity of purpose (Africansuccess.org, 2010; Nairaland.com, 2010).
1.4.5 Obateru Akinruntan
This entrepreneur comes from the Royal family in Ondo State, Nigeria. He is a king in Yoruba
land i.e. an Oba hence he has the appellate HRH (i.e. His Royal Highness); and also a
graduate of Business Administration from Lead City University Ibadan. He created the Obat
Oil and Petroleum Limited in 1981, a company that is into the marketing of petroleum
nation-wide, and has the largest privately owned oil depot and jetty in Africa. His business
interests have grown steadily over the years to become the Obat Group which has interests
in petroleum, fishery, construction, tourism and hospitality, shipping, consultancy services
and water purification and production (Obateru, 2010; Nairaland.com, 2010).
1.4.6 Paul Okafor
This Nigerian entrepreneur established Elbe Pharma, an organization that deals with the
importation and marketing of pharmaceutical products such as Amalar anti malaria tablets,
Solotone multivitamin etc. nation-wide.
1171.4.7 Poly Emenike
This is also an entrepreneur in the pharmaceutical industry. He established Neros
Pharmaceutical which imports and markets pharmaceutical products nation-wide.
1.4.8 Razaq Okoya
This Nigerian entrepreneur created the Eleganza industries. An organization that has
contributed tremendously to national development through its assortment of consumer
products such as biros and coolers manufactured and marketed nation-wide
(Nairaland.com, 2010).
1.4.9 Uche Uche Ohafia
This is another notable Nigerian entrepreneur in the shipping industry. He created the Trans
Atlantic Shipping Agency Limited. The company is into air freight, shipping line agency and
charter services, import and export agency, collateral management and warehousing
services among others.
Social entrepreneurs
And some notable Nigerian social entrepreneurs as identified by Osalor (2010) are:
1.4.10 Ada Onyejike
This is a female social entrepreneur who contributed to social development by launching
the Girl Child Art Foundation (GCAF) in the year 2000. This Foundation is concerned with
enlightenment and empowerment of the Nigerian young women between the ages of 8-25
years on issues such as: polygamy, child trafficking, and child marriage through music, art
and dance; with the ultimate aim of engineering progressive change in the Nigerian society.
1.4.11 Cletus Olebune
This is a social entrepreneur who focuses on the development of tourism in Africa. He
created an enterprise that promotes tourism in Africa by informing the world about events
taking place in Africa. He has also used written communication to educate and impart
knowledge which will help Nigerians in the different aspects of their lives and boost
productive engagements thereby improving Nigeria’s world ranking.
1.4.12 Durojaiye Isaac
He is the social entrepreneur with the slogan “Shit business is Good Business”. In 1999, he
established the DMT Mobile Toilets in Lagos. Prior to that period, Lagos State did not have
enough public toilets to cater for its teaming population. In order to help solve the social
problem created by this inadequate toilet facilities in Lagos State, Durojaiye established the
DMT Mobile Toilets, which is an organization that manufactures, hires out and maintain
moveable toilets in Lagos State. Thereby promoting environmental sanitation and creating
job opportunities in Lagos State.
1.4.13 Gabriel Uriel Ogunjimi
This is a social entrepreneur in the area of information technology. He was interested in
promoting employment opportunities for Nigerians. To this effect, he established the
Landmark Internship International, organization that helps meet Nigeria’s social and
economic challenges by using the internet to network globally with social enterprises in
need of local talents.
1181.4.14 Joachim Ezeji
Ezeji contributed to the social development of Nigeria by helping in the development of
community water infrastructure across the country through enhancing access to potable
water in remote Nigerian communities. To achieve this aim, in the year 2000 he established
the Rural Africa Water Development Project (RAWDP) which has tremendously assisted in
improving the standard of living of millions of Nigerians by giving them access to clean
potable water.
1.4.15 Rochas Okorocha
This is a social entrepreneur interested in poverty alleviation of the less privileged in the
Nigerian society. To this effect, he founded the Rochas Foundation which is concerned with
helping Nigerian children to become self sufficient thereby breaking the cycle of poverty in
the nation (Osalor, 2010).
Though as can be seen above we do have some entrepreneurs and social entrepreneurs in
Nigeria, they are still not adequate in number given its population of over 150 million.
Perhaps this underdevelopment of the entrepreneurial class is responsible for the current
status of the nation as a developing nation. For instance, China and India that were
previously in the same developmental class as Nigeria are now developing rapidly following
the flourishing of their entrepreneurial class (Sogbesan, 2009). Recently, the Nigerian
government recognized the importance of entrepreneurship to national development; this
is because apart from creating employment, and producing innovative goods and services,
entrepreneurs and social entrepreneurs also create wealth and generate social capital that
is needed for national development (Osalor, 2010). Consequently, the Nigerian government
has taken steps to encourage the development of entrepreneurship through the
formulation of various policies. This is why entrepreneurship as a course has been
introduced into the curriculum of all Nigerian universities.
1.5 The Nigerian Entrepreneur and Peculiarities of Nigerian Business
Environment
Though, starting a small business in Nigeria is much the same as starting a business in any
other part of the world, the Nigerian entrepreneur, unlike other entrepreneurs, faces some
challenges that are peculiar only to businesses established in Nigeria. This is because the
Nigerian business environment is very complex, uncertain and dynamic and as such, a lot of
factors operate at cross purposes in Nigeria. For example; many decisions that lack
rationality are made on a continuous basis; also various goverrnmental and macro-
economic policies which affect businesses are made and sometimes reversed instantly as
was the case in 1998 when the then Head of State General Abdulsalaam Abubakar increased
workers’ salaries and reversed it again after a few months on the ground that “he was ill
advised”! Thus, to survive in the Nigerian business environment, the Nigerian needs to
identify and have a thorough understanding of the mechanics, elements, dynamics, and
functioning of the Nigerian business environment. While bearing in mind that the Nigerian
economy is primarily a mixed economy. A mixed economy is midway between a free
market economy i.e. capitalist, and a pure planned economy i.e. socialist (Isimoya,1998;
Dixon-Ogbechi, 2003).

2.1 Importance of Entrepreneurship in economic development
Entrepreneurship and economic development in a nation rest on the tripod of
entrepreneurial enabling environment, a sound entrepreneurial education that promotes
and sustains entrepreneurial undertakings and a heightened entrepreneurship spirit or
mind-set amongst a people. According to them, in developing or underdeveloped economy,
development is a function of an enabling environment. By an enabling environment, we are
not referring only to the physical infrastructure existing in any given society (water supply,
roads, electricity, security, communication system, etc), but the legal and social functions
inclusive.
One of the conditions of serious consideration under enabling environment is the ethical
and legal platforms under which business transactions take place. The problem of
infrastructural development in Nigeria must be seen as rooted in society’s neglect of its
basic ethical practices and legal commitments. The legal system in a country, the
enforcement of the law, and the respect accorded the rule of law promote what is
considered as right or wrong in a firm’s interactions with its various stakeholders. For us to
provide adequate explanation about entrepreneurship and economic development, we
1222.2 Entrepreneurship and Nation-Building
The basic role of entrepreneurship in nation building is not just increasing per capita output
and income, it also includes:
i) Initiating and constituting change in the structure of business and society. The
change is accompanied by growth and increased output which allows for wealth
distribution.
ii) Product evaluation process: This is the process for developing and
commercializing an innovation. This stimulates economic development of a
nation.
iii) Iterative synthesis: The intersection of knowledge and social need that starts the
products development process.
iv) Innovation: Innovations are of various degrees or uniqueness. These include:
 Ordinary innovations.
 New products with little technological changes.
 Technological innovations.
 New products with significant technological advancement.
 Breakthrough innovations.
 New products with some technological change.
Developing entrepreneurs is a way of mobilizing individual and group talent, energy and
time to promote economic and social goals. Entrepreneurs find out business opportunities,
coordinate resources and innovate. In order for them to be able to function and play his
roles that will impact on the nation, needs to be flexible and adaptable to changes in the
economy. Entrepreneurs view changes as opportunity. They look at problems to see
opportunities. Their role in nations building cannot be overstated.

1232.3 Roles of Entrepreneurship in economic development
The importance of entrepreneurship development in economic development has been an
established fact in the literature. Ritter (1998) painted this picture about entrepreneurs and
economic development thus:
“Entrepreneurship is scarce for many types of economic activities in most countries and at
most times, particularly for new activities requiring relatively new types of technical and
market knowledge. The contribution of entrepreneurship to the process of economic
development is clear. Entrepreneurs are dynamic force in an economy, envisioning the
possibilities of new types of economic activity and doing everything necessary to realize
their visions. As a result, entrepreneurs give birth to new enterprises, new commercial
activities and new economic sectors. They generate jobs for others; they produce goods
and services for citizens; they introduce new cost-cutting or product-improving production
technologies and improved or lower-cost outputs; they earn foreign exchange through
exports expansion or the substitution of imports; they save, raise funds, and invest. They
also generate the income and wealth that permit the collection of taxes by governments for
expenditure on human development (education, health, and social services), physical
infrastructure and public goods generally. They promote the process of learning and
adapting to changing circumstances as technology changes, market evolve; and policies
change”.
Recognizing the important roles of entrepreneurs, both developed and developing nations
have shifted attention to their development. The need to create and ensure appropriate
environment for operations of the enterprises cannot be over emphasized.
Ritter (1998) noted that for entrepreneurship to progress the institutional environment, the
system of laws, the regulatory environment, and basic political and economic stability have
to exist and be consistent; absence of the enabling environment will deter the
entrepreneur. Nnanna (2003) acknowledged that SMEs are the bedrock of industrial
development; they provide large scale employment as they are often labour intensive and
they rely more heavily on local raw materials. Zakar (2006) classified the benefits of SMEs
and entrepreneurs into three broad categories – benefits to the nation, benefits to the
society and benefits to the individual. Olayiwola and Ogundele (2008) also pointed out the
roles of entrepreneurs as engine of growth and development. The study highlighted the
following roles among others:

Setting corporate ethical standards
Corporate ethical behavior involves both knowing what is rights and wrong and behaving
accordingly. Ethics emphase standards of moral behavior, that is behavior that is accepted
by society as right versus wrong. Organizational ethics begins at the top hence
entrepreneurs must uphold high ethical standard since behaving ethically have a positive
influence on the success of the business. Although ethical codes vary greatly, they can be
broadly classified as compliance-based and integrity-based. Compliance-based ethics codes
emphasize preventing unlawful behavior, by increasing control and by penalizing wrong
doers. While on the other hand, integrity-based ethics codes defines the organization’s
guiding values that create an environment that supports ethically sound behavior, and
stress a shared accountability among employees.
1242.4 Entrepreneurship Activity and Stages of Economic development
The type of entrepreneurship activity differs at different stages of economic development.
The literature identified two sets of entrepreneurial activity namely Necessity – driven self
–employment activity which is said to be associated with the stage of low levels of
economic development, as the economy may not be able to sustain a high number of jobs in
high productivity sectors. As the economy develops, more jobs are created and employment
opportunity would also be available hence necessity driven entrepreneurship will give way
to a more opportunistic –driven entrepreneurship activity. This tends to pick up, introducing
a qualitative change in overall entrepreneurial activity
The study of Porter, Sachs and MacAthur (2002) identified three stages of economic
development which include factor-driven economies, efficiency-driven economies and
innovation driven economies. Each stage is associated with different entrepreneurship
activity. Bosma et al (2009) relate each of the three stages to the entrepreneurial activity
2.4.1 Entrepreneurship in factor-driven economies
Lewis, (1954) noted that economic development consists of changes in the quantity and
character of economic value added and that these changes result in greater productivity and
rising per capita income. The study by Gries & Naude (2008) pointed out that the increased
productivity and the accompanying rise in per capita income often coincide with migration
of labor across different economic sectors in society, for example from primary and
extractive sectors to the manufacturing sector, and eventually, services . Countries with low
1252.4.2 Entrepreneurship in efficiency driven economies
As the industrial sector develops further, institutions start to emerge to support further
industrialization and the build-up of scale in the pursuit of higher productivity through
economies of scale. Typically, national economic policies in scale-intensive economies shape
their emerging economic and financial institutions to favor large national businesses. As
increasing economic productivity contributes to financial capital formation, niches may
open in industrial supply chains that service these national incumbents. This, combined with
the opening up of independent supply of financial capital from the emerging banking sector,
would expand opportunities for the development of small-scale and medium-sized
manufacturing sectors. Thus, in a scale-intensive economy, one would expect necessity-
driven industrial activity to gradually fall and give way to an emerging small-scale
manufacturing sector (Bosma, et al., 2009).
2.4.3 Entrepreneurship in Innovation - driven economies
As an economy matures and its wealth increases, one may expect the emphasis in industrial
activity to gradually shift toward an expanding service sector that caters to the needs of an
increasingly affluent population and supplies the services normally expected of a high-
income society. The industrial sector evolves and experiences improvements in variety and
sophistication. Such a development would be typically associated with increasing research
and development and knowledge intensity, as knowledge-generating institutions in the
economy gain momentum. This development opens the way for the development of
innovative, opportunity seeking entrepreneurial activity that is not afraid to challenge
established incumbents in the economy. Often, small and innovative entrepreneurial firms
enjoy an innovation productivity advantage over large incumbents, enabling them to
operate as ‘agents of creative destruction.’ To the extent that the economic and financial
institutions created during the scale-intensive phase of the economy are able to
accommodate and support opportunity-seeking entrepreneurial activity, innovative
entrepreneurial firms may emerge as significant drivers of economic growth and wealth
creation (Henrekson, 2005).
The various roles and activities of the entrepreneurs are inspiring, positive and they will
obviously enhance the well being of the society. For the entrepreneur to operate effectively
and efficiently, the institutional environment, the legal framework including the regulatory
environment, political stability, consistent economic policies have to exist. The absence of
these variables may hinder or deform entrepreneurship roles and activities. In other words
entrepreneurship alone is not capable and sufficient to generate the desired development;
1262.5 Entrepreneurial and functional education
Ekong and Williams (2003) have reported that there have been extensive calls for
entrepreneurial education in Nigeria. In 1983, the Federal Government of Nigeria urged
training institutions in the country to reorient their programmes towards vocational
relevance for the production of graduates that possess relevant skills for self-employment
and self-reliance. It is, however, observed that entrepreneurial education depends on a
functional education environment that provides motivation for the acquisition of relevant
skills and knowledge for entrepreneurial practices. In other words, training programmes in
Nigerian educational institutions, at all levels, should emphasize practical experiences in
related fields. This is important because, it is only through the inculcation of favourable
values, skills and competencies towards specific discipline that could be utilized in real life
situation.
Parkin (1994) in line with recent observations and reports from scholars like Obanya (2003)
and Williams (2002), have emphasized that entrepreneurship education must develop the
intellectual and favourable values, skills and competencies. This is because
entrepreneurship education posits that the purpose of education is to acquire the skills of
understanding life situation, adapting to it, acting to influence it, and contributing to
development through useful employment. In other words, entrepreneurial and functional
education should be able to:
 ensure that technical and vocational education are made integral part of education
for all;
 ensure that training in specialized technical and vocational skills are predicated on a
sound general education, complemented with a sound general exposure to technical
and vocational education;
 expose learners to the versatility of knowledge to meet the challenges of dynamism
of nature of the world of work;
 provide equal opportunities for both men and women to acquire technical and
vocational education;
 explore relevant methods, strategies and techniques of making technical and
vocational education affordable through informal and non-formal approaches.
Super (1983) described the entrepreneurship and functional education curriculum as that
which is learner-centred. In other words, the learning experiences involve interpretation of
occupational needs of the learners and assisting them to acquire integrated occupational
knowledge, skills and values about the real world through investigative or research
experiences. In other words, the curriculum process of the entrepreneurial and functional
1272.6 Vision 20-20-20
The Vision 202020, in Nigeria, as a strategy for development and progress. It is built on the
philosophy of the NEEDS document. NEEDS stands for National Economic Empowerment
and Development Strategy. The strategy came into operation in 2004. One of the major
pillars of NEEDS is growing the private sector which also involves youth empowerment.
Figure 1 below represents the structure of NEEDS where wealth creation, employment
generation, poverty reduction and values reorientation, all of which affect entrepreneurship
and ethical principles. As indicated, empowering people and youth development is central
to entrepreneurship. The emphasis of Vision 2020, however is that Nigeria aims to be
among the top 20 industrialized nations in the world by 2020 A.D. This is a positive
challenge to entrepreneurial and functional education in Nigeria. For instance, the vision
sets out a 7-point Agenda that will drive the process of achieving national objectives that
have implications for entrepreneurial and functional education.
The goals of the vision include; wealth creation,employment generation; poverty reduction,
and values reorientation.The macro-economic framework of the vision, on the other hand,
focuses on empowering the people, promoting private enterprise, and changing ways which
government does its work. Financial and plan implementaton strategies are also developed
to fast track the policies.
